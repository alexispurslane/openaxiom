Every character needs a biography first. This biography consists of two freeform fields: Appearance and History. These descriptions are crucial for defining a character's identity. Players should carefully consider their character's appearance and history when selecting skills and traits. The biography helps to ensure a character's mechanical representation aligns with their narrative concept.

** Appearance
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0B9A64E3-7CA9-40A6-9E0F-F9898CC59707
:END:

This field describes what a character looks like. It covers physical features, clothing, and any other visual characteristics. An appearance description can suggest certain skills or traits. For example, a character described as "exceptionally tall and gaunt" might have a high skill in *Stealth* or a trait representing *Frail Constitution*. A "heavily muscled individual with calloused hands" might have high *Strength* or a trait for *Powerful Build*.

** History
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3D684FED-E0D2-45A6-A12E-062778E76CD0
:END:

This field outlines a character's past experiences and background. It can include significant life events, training, or personal struggles. A character's history directly informs their skill and trait selection. For example, a "former deep-space miner" might have high *Piloting (Mining Vessels)* or a trait for *Claustrophobia*. A "childhood spent studying ancient languages" could lead to high *Linguistics* or a trait for *Bookish*.


* Character Points Pool
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       EA58C73B-5613-40B4-BB9E-70A1207743A1
:END:

Now that your character has an appearance and backstory, it's time to choose *skills* and *traits*, which are the main /mechanical/ features of a character in OpenAxiom. Yes, that's right: OpenAxiom *does not have character attributes, races, or classes!*

OpenAxiom uses a point-based character creation system for determining a character's starting skills and traits. Each player starts with a pool of character points, which represents the default human level of capability. The Game Master may adjust this pool up or down depending on the campaign's power level, typically ranging from 3-7 points, with 5 representing the average capabilities of an average human.

Character points can be spent in three ways:

1. *Increasing skills* above the default value of 9 (costs 1 point per skill level above 9)
2. *Purchasing positive traits* (costs 1 point per trait level)
3. *Purchasing negative traits* (gains 1 point per trait level)

Skills, positive traits, and negative traits all cost points at a 1:1 ratio, making them equally valuable in character creation.

Players can spend multiple character points on a single skill to increase it by more than one level. For example, a player could spend 3 points to increase a skill from 9 to 12, or 5 points to increase a skill from 9 to 14.

For example, a player with 5 character points could:
- Buy a skill at 14 (costs 5 points), using all 5 points
- Or buy a skill at 12 (costs 3 points) and a +2 positive trait (costs 2 points), using all 5 points
- Or buy a skill at 11 (costs 2 points), a +2 positive trait (costs 2 points), and a -3 negative trait (gains 3 points), for a total cost of 1 point, leaving 4 points remaining
- Or distribute points across many smaller improvements

Players may not reduce skills below the default value of 9 to gain additional character points. This prevents players from creating dump stats to gain an excessive number of character points.

*Each chosen skill, positive trait, and negative trait must be justified by a one-sentence appeal to the character's Appearance and History sections.* The Game Master must approve this justification.

* Skills
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       BB8F9C54-4E34-4B80-9705-607D67F5FC0B
:END:

A skill represents anything a character can do or be. This includes physical abilities like strength or swimming, and mental aptitudes such as various forms of intelligence. Skills are trainable, meaning a character's proficiency can improve over time. Skills have a name and a numerical value, indicating proficiency. Any skill not explicitly listed on a character's sheet has the default value of 9.

Skills in OpenAxiom range from 3 to 18, matching the possible range of a 3d6 roll. This range represents the full spectrum of human capability:

- 3: *Hopeless* - Virtually no chance of success
- 9: *Average* - Baseline human capability
- 18: *Legendary* - Automatic success under normal conditions

All skills start at the default value of 9. Players can increase skills above 9 using their character points, but cannot decrease skills below 9 to gain additional points.

Players may choose specific skills without choosing the more general version. For example, a character can have *Piloting (Starship)* without having *Piloting*. When a character has a specific skill but not its more general version, they can only use that specific skill for tasks that match it exactly. They cannot use it as a substitute for other specializations of the same general skill.

* Trait Selection
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       F18E6B88-ACAD-45C5-8232-D7C7237CD7E6
:END:

During character creation, players may also use their character points pool to purchase positive and negative traits from lists provided by the Game Master. Traits represent inherent skills, talents, or aptitudes your character may have.

** Trait Values
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       TRAIT-VALUES
:END:

All traits are inherently either *positive* (a boost) or *negative* (a hindrance). However, *traits do not have an inherent value by default.*

Instead, players choose the value of each trait they want to take, and then spend or gain that many character points accordingly. For positive traits, the player chooses a value and spends that many character points from their pool. For negative traits, the player chooses a value and gains that many character points to their pool.

Each chosen trait must be justified by a one-sentence appeal to the character's Appearance and History sections. The Game Master must approve this justification.

** Trait Categories
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1A2B3C4D-5E6F-7G8H-9I0J-1K2L3M4N5O6P
:END:

Traits are divided into four categories that determine how and when they apply:

- *Broad Traits*: Affect entire skill categories (like all *Social* skills) and represent fundamental aspects of your character.
- *Narrow Traits*: Affect specific skills (like just *Art (Music)*) and represent specialized talents or limitations.
- *Situational Traits*: Only apply under specific conditions (like in darkness or extreme cold) as determined by the GM.
- *Special Traits*: Add unique game rules beyond simple bonuses, such as special abilities or rerolls.

** Skills Versus Traits
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       040BB6C1-BF52-4F4E-8AFC-67A26200B20C
:END:

There are several important tradeoffs between skills and traits. The following table summarizes the key differences:

| Aspect | Skills | Traits |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Improvement | Can change and improve over time | Static and cannot be improved |
| Bonus Size | Can give a much larger bonus in particular skills (up to +9) | Capped at +5 per trait |
| Scope | Affects only the specific skill | Can apply to many skills at once |
| Maximum Value | Cap at 18 | Can stack on top of skills for a maximum of 23 |
| Versatility | Limited to specific skill improvement | Can introduce new rules and special abilities |
| Mechanical Variety | Simple numerical bonuses | Wide variety including special abilities and lore items |
| Negative Effects | None | Can impose penalties or limitations |
| Character Development | Can overcome negative traits to some degree | Persistent advantages or disadvantages throughout game |

Moreover, while positive skill improvement can overcome negative traits to a certain degree, skill values cap out at 18, meaning that while a character with a negative trait may equal or surpass other characters without such a negative trait with regards to some skill in the middle of the distribution, at the tail ends of character development, they will fall behind: characters with negative traits both start the game at a disadvantage and, when characters finish training, end at one. For instance, a character with a trait that applies a -5 to *Mental (Reasoning)* can dump all of their character points, including the 5 provided by that negative trait, into that skill in order to reach 14, but that's the highest they could go, whereas a character with no such disability can reach 18.

** Traits and Lore Items
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       B67FDE9E-C707-4900-B05D-328421028608
:END:

Some traits may come with associated lore items that a character must carry with them as a result of having that trait. These items are typically Small or Medium in size and don't confer mechanical advantages beyond what the trait itself provides. For example, a character with the *Photographic Memory* trait might carry a cybernetic implant, or a character with *Night Vision* might have special eye drops or wear tinted glasses. These items are considered part of the character's backstory and serve to reinforce the narrative justification for the trait.

Lore items associated with traits are automatically provided to characters during character creation and do not count against their inventory slot limits. However, they can be lost or damaged during play, potentially affecting the character's ability to use their trait effectively until the item is replaced.

* Item Selection
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       13D011F3-1ADC-419C-8918-869AE4B302EB
:END:

During character creation, characters start with all items required by their skills, plus any worldbuilding or lore items they want, as long as those don't confer a mechanical advantage.

Your best strength-related skill determines the number of inventory slots you have available to carry items. Strength-related skills include *Physical (Strength)*, *Physical (Endurance)*, and any other skills that the Game Master deems appropriate for determining carrying capacity.

Items are categorized into four size classes that determine how they consume inventory slots:

- *Small* (S): These items can be fit two per inventory slot (e.g., a dagger, a book, a small tool).
- *Medium* (M): These items require one inventory slot (e.g., a sword, a backpack, a rope).
- *Large* (L): These items require two inventory slots (e.g., a suit of armor, a large weapon, a chest).
- *Extra Large* (XL): These items require multiple players to carry, with each participant using all of their open slots for the duration (e.g., a canoe, a large piece of furniture, a heavy statue).

This information helps you understand how many items your character can realistically carry when selecting starting equipment.

* Factions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       FACTIONS-CHARACTER-CREATION
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class section-icon
[[file:static/factions.svg]]

During character creation, players should consider which faction their character primarily identifies with, consulting with their Game Master to determine what factions are available in the game's setting and which would be reasonable for a player in the planned campaign to be a part of. This faction represents their background, cultural upbringing, or primary affiliation.

This choice helps inform the character's background and can suggest appropriate skills and traits. For example, a character from a scholarly faction might have high *Languages* or *Investigation* skills, while one from a criminal faction might excel in *Social (Deception)* or *Physical (Stealth)*.

Players should consult with their Game Master to determine what factions are appropriate for the story and setting. The GM may have specific factions in mind for the campaign, or may allow players to propose their own.

Characters start with a reputation score of 3 with their chosen primary home faction, representing their familiarity and standing within their own community. As the character encounters members of other factions during play, their reputation with those factions will be tracked separately, starting at 0 for neutral first encounters.

The Game Master should use the expanded faction relationship system where initial reputation with new factions is determined by the character's existing relationships. See the Social Relations chapter for details on this core rule.

* Character Creation Examples

** Fantasy Example: Elara, the Forest Hunter and Tracker
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4EFD166D-4325-44C8-B8B2-7C6872F61E7D
:END:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A player wants to create a fantasy character named Elara with a 5-point character pool. The player envisions Elara as a nimble hunter and tracker from a secluded forest village.

First, the player writes Elara's biography. For Appearance, the player describes Elara as "lithe and quick, with sharp eyes and practical leather clothing suited for the forest." For History, the player writes, "Elara grew up in a reclusive elven community in a deep forest. She was trained as a hunter and tracker, protecting her village from woodland dangers. She has recently left her home to explore the wider world."

Next, the player allocates their character points to skills and traits. Starting with 5 points:
- The player buys *Combat (Ranged) (Bow)* at 12 (costs 3 points)
- The player buys *Survival (Wilderness) (Forest)* at 11 (costs 2 points)
- This uses all 5 character points

During character creation, Elara also receives items appropriate to her skills and background. Her best strength-related skill is *Physical (Acrobatics)* at 9 (default), giving her 9 inventory slots.
- *Elven Composite Bow*: A Medium item that is required for her *Combat (Ranged) (Bow)* skill. Without it, she cannot make bow attacks. Requires a minimum *Combat (Ranged) (Bow)* skill of 10 to use effectively.
- *Leather Armor*: A Medium item that provides protection but doesn't confer mechanical advantages in the core rules.
- *Hunting Knife*: A Small item that could be used for close combat or utility tasks.
- *Bedroll and Camping Supplies*: A Medium item that allows automatic success on *Survival (Wilderness)* checks for setting up camp.
- *Herbalism Kit*: A Medium item that aids in identifying plants and treating minor wounds, granting automatic success on certain *Survival (Wilderness)* checks.
- *Elven Rations*: Several Small items to sustain her during her travels.
- *Forest Cloak*: A Medium item that helps with stealth in woodland environments, providing automatic success on certain *Physical (Stealth)* checks when in forests.

Finally, the player selects traits using additional character points. Since the player has already spent all their initial points on skills, they choose traits that provide points to spend on other traits:
- The player chooses the negative trait *Claustrophobia* and gives it a value of -2, gaining 2 character points

  This trait will impose a -2 penalty on all skill checks when Elara is in a confined space.

  Justification: "Having spent her life in the open wilderness, she is unnerved and distracted in confined spaces."

- With the 2 points gained, the player chooses the positive trait *Night Vision* and gives it a value of +2, costing 2 points

  This trait will grant a +2 bonus to perception-based skills like *Physical (Tracking)* in low-light conditions.

  Justification: "Her elven heritage and life in the dim forest have given her excellent sight in low light."

The Game Master approves the justifications, and Elara is ready to play.

** Science Fiction Example: Jax, the Freelance Engineer
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       C63E0526-9D02-4402-AB77-0888DF0A4F72
:END:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Another player decides to create a science fiction character, a street-smart engineer named Jax with a 5-point character pool.

The player starts with the biography. For Appearance, Jax is "a tall, wiry man with a cybernetic implant replacing his left eye. He wears a worn, grease-stained mechanic's jumpsuit." For History, the player writes, "Jax is a former corporate engineer who grew disillusioned with the megacorporations. He now lives in the underbelly of a sprawling metropolis, working as a freelance mechanic and information broker."

With the biography established, the player allocates their character points to skills and traits. Starting with 5 points:
- The player buys *Engineering (Robotics)* at 12 (costs 3 points)
- The player buys *Computers (Hacking)* at 11 (costs 2 points)
- This uses all 5 character points

During character creation, Jax also receives items appropriate to his skills and background. His best strength-related skill is *Physical (Strength)* at 9 (default), giving him 9 inventory slots.
- *Cybernetic Eye Implant*: A Lore item associated with his *Photographic Memory* trait. This is a permanent part of his body that doesn't count against his inventory slots.
- *Multi-tool Kit*: A Medium item required for many *Engineering* checks, allowing him to work on various mechanical devices.
- *Portable Computer*: A Medium item that is required for his *Computers (Hacking)* skill. Without it, he cannot attempt hacking checks.
- *Holdout Pistol*: A Small item that is required for his *Combat (Ranged) (Pistol)* skill. Requires a minimum *Combat (Ranged) (Pistol)* skill of 8 to use effectively.
- *Tech Repair Kit*: A Medium item that provides automatic success on certain *Engineering* checks for routine maintenance.
- *Street Clothes*: A Medium item that doesn't confer mechanical advantages but fits his background.
- *Data Storage Device*: A Small item for storing large amounts of information he's collected.
- *Emergency Rations*: Several Small items for survival during extended jobs.

Now, the player moves to traits, using additional character points. Since the player has already spent all their initial points on skills, they choose traits that provide points to spend on other traits:
- The player chooses the negative trait *Absent-Minded* and gives it a value of -2, gaining 2 character points

  This will impose a -2 penalty on perception and attention-based skills.

  Justification: "The constant stream of data from his implant sometimes causes him to forget mundane details."

- The player chooses the negative trait *Slow Learner* and gives it a value of -1, gaining 1 character point

  This will increase the story point cost for him to learn new skills.

  Justification: "He is highly specialized and struggles to learn new skills outside of his established expertise."

- With the 3 points gained, the player chooses the positive trait *Photographic Memory* and gives it a value of +3, costing 3 points

  This will grant a +3 bonus to his knowledge-based skills like *Engineering (Robotics)* and *Computers (Hacking)*.

  Justification: "His cybernetic eye implant allows him to perfectly recall technical schematics and information."

The Game Master reviews the justifications and approves them. Jax is now ready for the game.
