OpenAxiom is a free and open source tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) engine. Rather than providing a complete game with predefined settings, characters, or monsters, OpenAxiom focuses purely on the core mechanics needed for any TTRPG. It's designed to be setting and genre agnostic, with modular "packs" that can be mixed and matched to create the specific game you want to play.

The system is simulationist at its core, meaning that mechanics exist to directly represent actions and consequences in the game world. The rules avoid unnecessary complexity, ensuring that any situation can be resolved with simple arithmetic and a single table lookup.

OpenAxiom provides mechanical crunch for all aspects of gameplay, from combat to social interactions to character development. The system emphasizes meaningful stakes where every risk is a choice and every outcome has weight, but nothing is unrecoverable with effort and preparation.

The core mechanic is based on a /logic of action and consequences/. Rather than having specific rules for magic or technology, OpenAxiom provides a framework for simulating any action. Players and Game Masters assign names to actions and outcomes, and the system processes them consistently regardless of the specific fictional context.

1. [[file:player_characters.html][Player Characters: Properties, Creation, Inventory, Statuses, and Advancement]]

   This section describes what player characters are in OpenAxiom and how to create them. Player characters are defined by skills and traits rather than character classes or traditional attributes. This approach allows for flexible and organic character development, enabling players to build unique individuals. The rules presented here guide the player through each step of character definition, from initial concept to fully-realized character.

2. [[file:core_game_loop.html][Core Game Loop: The Turn System]]

   OpenAxiom uses two distinct types of game time to create a dynamic and flexible gameplay experience: tactical time and scene time. These different pacing mechanisms allow the game to shift between intense, structured sequences and free-flowing narrative moments as needed. The transition between tactical and scene time is a binary decision made by the Game Master based on the needs of the narrative and the intensity of the situation.

3. [[file:logic_of_action.html][Logic of Action: Core Decision Resolution Mechanism]]

   This section describes the decision resolution mechanism for actions in OpenAxiom. When a character attempts an action with a meaningful chance of failure, the player and Game Master use the logic of action to determine the outcome. This system provides a consistent framework for resolving uncertainty while maintaining narrative flow. The fundamental mechanic is rolling 3d6 and comparing the result to a target number.

4. [[file:combat.org][Combat: The Core Mechanics, and Advanced Modules]]

   Combat situations arise naturally in many genres and settings. OpenAxiom recognizes that violence is sometimes necessary in fiction, and that in fact it is often a key aspect of why people enjoy TTRPGs, and so provides mechanics that make these scenes engaging and meaningful. The system uses an Ablative Injury System with specific body locations, each with their own pool of Hit Points, and models realistic consequences of violence with the Harm Tracker system.
