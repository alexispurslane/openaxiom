Channeling is the universal mechanism for extraordinary abilities. This system provides a genre-less and setting-less framework for powers like psionics, magic, nanotech manipulation, reality bending, or quickhacking. The rules for Channeling are designed to be abstract and flexible. This allows Game Masters to adapt them to any setting.

Like the combat system, the Channeling rules are optional. Tables that prefer a lower-fantasy or more grounded setting can choose to ignore this chapter entirely. These rules are for tables that enjoy characters with supernatural or superhuman powers.

* The Channeling System
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1EAD2A7E-4A9A-4F8B-9A7C-6A1B3E7D8C5F
:END:

The Channeling system is based on a character's skill, ability slots, and the specific abilities the character has prepared.

** Channeling Skills
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       A2EAD3B8-5B0B-5G9C-0B8D-7B2C4F8E9D6G
:END:

Channeling is a general skill category. This skill represents a character's ability to harness and control extraordinary energies or forces. Like other skills, it has a numerical value. The default value for the general *Channeling* skill is 9.

Specific types of Channeling are represented as specializations. For example:
- *Channeling (Magic)* for spellcasters.
- *Channeling (Psionics)* for psychics.
- *Channeling (Nanotech)* for characters manipulating microscopic robots.
- *Channeling (Cybernetics)* for characters manipulating implants and networked devices.
- *Channeling (Reality)* for reality benders.

The Game Master determines which Channeling specializations are available in the game world. Players can use the general *Channeling* skill for a specialized task with the standard penalties.

** Ability Slots
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       B3FBE4C9-6C1C-6H0D-1C9E-8C3D5G9F0E7H
:END:

A character's ability to manage and prepare Channeling abilities is determined by their highest skill value within the *Channeling* skill hierarchy. This skill value determines the number of ability slots a character has.

| Best Channeling Skill | Ability Slots |
|-----------------------+---------------|
| 9-10                  | 1             |
| 11-12                 | 2             |
| 13-14                 | 3             |
| 15-16                 | 4             |
| 17-18                 | 5             |

A character can prepare a number of abilities equal to their available slots. These abilities are chosen from a list of abilities the character knows. A character can only change their prepared abilities between game sessions. This represents a period of rest, meditation, or recalibration.

As a character's skill value increases through character advancement, their number of ability slots also increases, representing the greater number of abilities they can wrangle.

** Channeling Abilities
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       C4GCF5DA-7D2D-7I1E-2D0F-9D4E6H0G1F8I
:END:

Channeling abilities are specific applications of a character's power. Each ability has a defined effect, an Action Point (AP) cost, and a =Required Skill= level.

By default, activating an ability is a single Major Action that does not require a skill check from the user. The power simply works. However, more complex abilities may have different activation requirements, drawing on other core mechanics of the game. These can include requiring prerequisite items, or functioning as a Group Action, an Extended Action, or even a Contested Extended Action. These special conditions will be listed in the ability's definition.

If an ability targets another character who is aware of the attempt, the target may be able to resist. This is resolved as a [[./logic_of_action.md#contested-actions][Contested Action]]. The Channeller does not roll; their 'roll' is considered an automatic **Standard Success**. The defender then rolls their relevant defense skill. The outcome is determined by the defender's degree of success:

- *Failure (Marginal, Exceptional, or Critical):* The ability takes its full effect.
- *Standard Success:* The ability takes its full effect, as the channeler wins the tie. However, the defender gains *Momentum*.
- *Exceptional Success:* The defender successfully overcomes the ability's effect. The power rebounds, and the channeler gains one level of Flux.
- *Critical Success:* The defender not only overcomes the ability, but turns it back on the channeler. The ability fails, and the channeler must immediately roll on the Resonance Cascade table.

The format for defining a Channeling ability is as follows:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class trait-definition
| Ability Name      | Required Skill |
|-------------------+----------------|
| Prerequisites     | [List of required abilities, or None] |
| Activation        | [Activation method, e.g., Major Action, Extended Action (3 turns)] |
| AP Cost           | [AP cost]      |
| Effect            | [Description of the effect] |
| Defense           | [Skill used for defense, if any] |

Some powerful abilities may also require knowledge of other, more basic abilities as a *Prerequisite*. This represents a character building on their foundational knowledge to create more complex effects.

An ability is considered "learned" once it has been successfully used four times. An ability's prerequisite abilities must have been fully learned (used successfully four times each) before the more advanced ability can be selected and prepared in an ability slot. This learning mechanism represents the practice and mastery needed to build upon foundational abilities.

*** Example Abilities

Here are some example abilities to illustrate the system.

* Modifying Abilities with Techniques
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ABILITY-TECHNIQUES
:END:

Channelers can learn to alter their abilities on the fly, applying special techniques to change how their powers manifest. Applying a technique is a choice made just before an ability is activated. A character can apply multiple techniques to a single ability, provided they can pay the combined costs.

The following techniques are available:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class trait-definition
| Technique  | Cost | Effect |
|------------+------+--------|
| *Distant*  | +2 AP | Doubles the ability's effective range. If the ability does not have a range, this technique has no effect. |
| *Subtle*   | +1 Flux | The ability manifests with no obvious sensory effects (e.g., no flash of light, no sound). This makes its source difficult to pinpoint. |
| *Empowered* | +4 AP, +1 Flux | Increases the numerical effects of the ability (damage, healing, number of targets, etc.) by 50%, rounded up. |
| *Swift*    | Double AP Cost | Halves the number of turns required for an ability activated by an Extended or Contested Extended Action. |
| *Non-lethal* | +1 AP | Any damage inflicted by the ability is temporary. The target recovers fully at the end of the scene without lasting injury. This only applies to abilities that inflict Physical harm. |

* Channeling and Consequences
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       D5HDG6EB-8E3E-8J2F-3E1G-0E5F7I1H2G9J
:END:

Using Channeling abilities can have consequences, both for the target and sometimes for the channeler.

** Inflicting Harm
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       E6IEH7FC-9F4F-9K3G-4F2H-1F6G8J2I3H0K
:END:

Some Channeling abilities can inflict harm. The type of harm depends on the nature of the ability. A psychic attack might inflict Mental harm. A magical fireblast would inflict Physical harm. A public humiliation curse could inflict Social harm. The ability's description will specify the type and amount of harm. This harm is applied to the relevant [[./character_mechanics.md#character-status-effects][Harm Tracker]].

** The Perils of Channeling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       F7JFI8GD-0G5G-0L4H-5G3I-2G7H9K3J4I1L
:END:

Channeling powerful, unstable energies has consequences. Using abilities beyond one's level of mastery introduces risk and instability in the form of Flux.

*** Pushing Your Limits and Gaining Flux
A character can attempt to use a Channeling ability even if their relevant skill is lower than the ability's =Required Skill=. This is known as "Pushing." While this allows for greater flexibility and power, it comes at the cost of gaining Flux.

For each point a character's skill is below the requirement, they gain one level of Flux immediately after the ability is used. For example, using an ability with a =Required Skill= of 13 when your character's skill is 11 will cause you to gain two levels of Flux.

*** The Flux System
Flux is a tracker, similar to the Harm trackers, that represents a character's growing instability from channeling energies beyond their control. It has four levels. A character's Flux level can only increase from Pushing, and it is reduced through rest or specific actions.

*** Flux Levels and Effects
- *Level 1 (Flickering):* The character's control is slightly compromised. Any character defending against their abilities gains a +1 bonus to the skill they're rolling against, increasing their chances of resisting.
- *Level 2 (Unstable):* The power becomes volatile. Every time the character Pushes to gain Flux, including the instance that moved them up to this level, a *Resonance Cascade* occurs.
- *Level 3 (Overloaded):* The character is struggling to contain the power. They take a -2 penalty to all non-Channeling skill checks, in addition to the effects of the previous level.
- *Level 4 (Burnout):* The character is overwhelmed. They immediately take one level of Mental Harm and cannot use any Channeling abilities until their Flux is reduced below Level 4.

*** Resonance Cascade
When a Resonance Cascade is triggered, roll a d6 on the following table to determine the outcome:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class resonance-cascade-table
| Roll d6 | Outcome |
|---------+---------|
| 1       | *Unexpected Failure:* The ability fails to manifest. The AP cost is spent and Flux is gained, but nothing happens. |
| 2       | *Ability Backlash:* The ability targets the channeler instead of their intended target. If the ability was self-targeted, it hits the nearest enemy instead. If that is not possible, it fails. |
| 3       | *Chaotic Scramble:* The intended ability fails. Instead, one of the channeler's other prepared abilities (chosen randomly) activates on the original target. |
| 4       | *Energy Bleed:* The raw power lashes back at the channeler. They immediately take one level of Harm on a tracker relevant to their Channeling type (e.g., Physical for Nanotech, Mental for Psionics). |
| 5       | *Wild Manifestation:* The ability's effect also hits a random target (friend or foe) within 5 hexes, but with half effect. If no other target is in range, the channeler takes the half effect. |
| 6       | *Power Surge:* The ability's numerical effects (damage, healing, range, etc.) are unexpectedly doubled. This can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. |

*** Reducing Flux
A character can reduce their Flux in two ways:
1. *Rest:* A full night of rest reduces a character's Flux by one level.
2. *Grounding:* A character can take a Major Action to ground themselves. This requires a skill check against an effective skill value of 10, the same for all characters no matter their actual skill level. A success reduces Flux by one level.
