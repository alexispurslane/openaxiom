                <h1 id="2-character-creation">2. Character Creation</h1>
<p>This document is the guide for "Session Zero." It contains everything a
player needs to build a character from concept to completion.</p>
<h2 id="21-biography">2.1. Biography</h2>
<p><img src="static/biography.svg" class="section-icon" /></p>
<p>Every character needs a biography first. This biography consists of two
freeform fields: Appearance and History. These descriptions are crucial
for defining a character's identity. Players should carefully consider
their character's appearance and history when selecting skills and
traits. The biography helps to ensure a character's mechanical
representation aligns with their narrative concept.</p>
<h3 id="211-appearance">2.1.1. Appearance</h3>
<p>This field describes what a character looks like. It covers physical
features, clothing, and any other visual characteristics. An appearance
description can suggest certain skills or traits. For example, a
character described as "exceptionally tall and gaunt" might have a high
skill in <strong>Stealth</strong> or a trait representing <strong>Frail Constitution</strong>. A
"heavily muscled individual with calloused hands" might have high
<strong>Strength</strong> or a trait for <strong>Powerful Build</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="212-history">2.1.2. History</h3>
<p>This field outlines a character's past experiences and background. It
can include significant life events, training, or personal struggles. A
character's history directly informs their skill and trait selection.
For example, a "former deep-space miner" might have high <strong>Piloting
(Mining Vessels)</strong> or a trait for <strong>Claustrophobia</strong>. A "childhood spent
studying ancient languages" could lead to high <strong>Linguistics</strong> or a
trait for <strong>Bookish</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="22-character-points-pool">2.2. Character Points Pool</h2>
<p>Now that your character has an appearance and backstory, it's time to
choose <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>traits</strong>, which are the main <em>mechanical</em>
features of a character in OpenAxiom. Yes, that's right: OpenAxiom
<strong>does not have character attributes, races, or classes!</strong></p>
<p>OpenAxiom uses a point-based character creation system for determining a
character's starting skills and traits. Each player starts with a pool
of character points, which represents the default human level of
capability. The Game Master may adjust this pool up or down depending on
the campaign's power level, typically ranging from 3-7 points, with 5
representing the average capabilities of an average human.</p>
<p>Character points can be spent in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Increasing skills</strong> above the default value of 9 (costs 1 point
    per skill level above 9, unlike <em>story points</em>, which are used to
    upgrade characters after creation, and have an increasing cost
    curve)</li>
<li><strong>Purchasing positive traits</strong> (costs 1 point per trait level)</li>
<li><strong>Purchasing negative traits</strong> (gains 1 point per trait level)</li>
</ol>
<p>Skills, positive traits, and negative traits all cost points at a 1:1
ratio, making them equally valuable in character creation.</p>
<p>Players can spend multiple character points on a single skill to
increase it by more than one level. For example, a player could spend 3
points to increase a skill from 9 to 12, or 5 points to increase a skill
from 9 to 14.</p>
<p>For example, a player with 5 character points could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a skill at 14 (costs 5 points), using all 5 points</li>
<li>Or buy a skill at 12 (costs 3 points) and a +2 positive trait (costs 2
  points), using all 5 points</li>
<li>Or buy a skill at 11 (costs 2 points), a +2 positive trait (costs 2
  points), and a -3 negative trait (gains 3 points), for a total cost of
  1 point, leaving 4 points remaining</li>
<li>Or distribute points across many smaller improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Players may not reduce skills below the default value of 9 to gain
additional character points. This prevents players from creating dump
stats to gain an excessive number of character points.</p>
<p><strong>Each chosen skill, positive trait, and negative trait must be
justified by a one-sentence appeal to the character's Appearance and
History sections.</strong> The Game Master must approve this justification.</p>
<h2 id="23-skills">2.3. Skills</h2>
<p>A skill represents anything a character can do or be. This includes
physical abilities like strength or swimming, and mental aptitudes such
as various forms of intelligence. Skills are trainable, meaning a
character's proficiency can improve over time. Skills have a name and a
numerical value, indicating proficiency. Any skill not explicitly listed
on a character's sheet has the default value of 9.</p>
<p>Skills in OpenAxiom range from 3 to 18, matching the possible range of a
3d6 roll. This range represents the full spectrum of human capability:</p>
<ul>
<li>3: <strong>Hopeless</strong> - Virtually no chance of success</li>
<li>9: <strong>Average</strong> - Baseline human capability</li>
<li>18: <strong>Legendary</strong> - Automatic success under normal conditions</li>
</ul>
<p>All skills start at the default value of 9. Players can increase skills
above 9 using their character points, but cannot decrease skills below 9
to gain additional points.</p>
<p>Players may choose specific skills without choosing the more general
version. For example, a character can have <strong>Piloting (Starship)</strong>
without having <strong>Piloting</strong>. When a character has a specific skill but
not its more general version, they can only use that specific skill for
tasks that match it exactly. They cannot use it as a substitute for
other specializations of the same general skill.</p>
<h2 id="24-trait-selection">2.4. Trait Selection</h2>
<p>During character creation, players may also use their character points
pool to purchase positive and negative traits from lists provided by the
Game Master. Traits represent inherent skills, talents, or aptitudes
your character may have.</p>
<h3 id="241-trait-values">2.4.1. Trait Values</h3>
<p>All traits are inherently either <strong>positive</strong> (a boost) or <strong>negative</strong>
(a hindrance). However, <strong>traits do not have an inherent value by
default.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, players choose the value of each trait they want to take, and
then spend or gain that many character points accordingly. For positive
traits, the player chooses a value and spends that many character points
from their pool. For negative traits, the player chooses a value and
gains that many character points to their pool.</p>
<p>Each chosen trait must be justified by a one-sentence appeal to the
character's Appearance and History sections. The Game Master must
approve this justification.</p>
<h3 id="242-trait-categories">2.4.2. Trait Categories</h3>
<p>Traits are divided into four categories that determine how and when they
apply:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Broad Traits</strong>: Affect entire skill categories (like all <strong>Social</strong>
  skills) and represent fundamental aspects of your character.</li>
<li><strong>Narrow Traits</strong>: Affect specific skills (like just <strong>Art (Music)</strong>)
  and represent specialized talents or limitations.</li>
<li><strong>Situational Traits</strong>: Only apply under specific conditions (like in
  darkness or extreme cold) as determined by the GM.</li>
<li><strong>Special Traits</strong>: Add unique game rules beyond simple bonuses, such
  as special abilities or rerolls.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="243-skills-versus-traits">2.4.3. Skills Versus Traits</h3>
<p>There are several important tradeoffs between skills and traits. The
following table summarizes the key differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aspect</th>
<th>Skills</th>
<th>Traits</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Improvement</td>
<td>Can change and improve over time</td>
<td>Static and cannot be improved</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maximum Value</td>
<td>Cap at 18</td>
<td>Can stack on top of skills for a maximum of 23</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scope</td>
<td>Affects only the specific skill</td>
<td>Can apply to many skills at once</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bonus Size</td>
<td>Can give a much larger bonus in particular skills (up to +9)</td>
<td>Capped at +5 per trait</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Special Effects</td>
<td>Simple numerical bonuses</td>
<td>Can introduce new rules and special abilities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative Effects</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>Can impose penalties or limitations</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Moreover, while positive skill improvement can overcome negative traits
to a certain degree, skill values cap out eventually, meaning that
characters with negative traits will not only start out with a
disadvantage, but also eventually fall behind those without such traits
who can reach the full cap without a negative modifier. This means that
negative traits create a permanent disadvantage that becomes more
pronounced at the extremes of character development. Therefore, it is
recommended to work <em>with</em> negative traits, not against them.</p>
<p>For example, a character with a trait that applies a -5 penalty to
<strong>Mental (Reasoning)</strong> can spend all their available character points (5
CP gained from the negative trait + the 5 starting CP) to .increase that
skill to the maximum possible value of 18 (costing 9 of their 10
available points), but it will effectively be only 13 thanks to the
negative trait, whereas a character with no such disability can reach
18, and a character with a relevant positive trait can reach 23.
Therefore, while spending <em>some</em> skill points on that skill, to get it
back up to a reasonable level to compensate for the negative trait,
makes sense, spending all 10 skill points was a waste of time for the
character. Those points could have been more effectively spent
elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="244-traits-and-lore-items">2.4.4. Traits and Lore Items</h3>
<p>Some traits may come with associated lore items that a character must
carry with them as a result of having that trait. These items are
typically Small or Medium in size and don't confer mechanical advantages
beyond what the trait itself provides. For example, a character with the
<strong>Photographic Memory</strong> trait might carry a cybernetic implant, or a
character with <strong>Night Vision</strong> might have special eye drops or wear
tinted glasses. These items are considered part of the character's
backstory and serve to reinforce the narrative justification for the
trait.</p>
<p>Lore items associated with traits are automatically provided to
characters during character creation and do not count against their
inventory slot limits. However, they can be lost or damaged during play,
potentially affecting the character's ability to use their trait
effectively until the item is replaced.</p>
<h2 id="25-item-selection">2.5. Item Selection</h2>
<p>During character creation, characters start with all items required by
their skills, plus any worldbuilding or lore items they want, as long as
those don't confer a mechanical advantage.</p>
<p>Your best strength-related skill determines the number of inventory
slots you have available to carry items. Strength-related skills include
<strong>Physical (Strength)</strong>, <strong>Physical (Endurance)</strong>, and any other skills
that the Game Master deems appropriate for determining carrying
capacity.</p>
<p>Items are categorized into four size classes that determine how they
consume inventory slots:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Small</strong> (S): These items can be fit two per inventory slot (e.g., a
  dagger, a book, a small tool).</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> (M): These items require one inventory slot (e.g., a sword,
  a backpack, a rope).</li>
<li><strong>Large</strong> (L): These items require two inventory slots (e.g., a suit
  of armor, a large weapon, a chest).</li>
<li><strong>Extra Large</strong> (XL): These items require multiple players to carry,
  with each participant using all of their open slots for the duration
  (e.g., a canoe, a large piece of furniture, a heavy statue).</li>
</ul>
<p>This information helps you understand how many items your character can
realistically carry when selecting starting equipment.</p>
<h2 id="26-factions">2.6. Factions</h2>
<p><img src="static/factions.svg" class="section-icon" /></p>
<p>During character creation, players should consider which faction their
character primarily identifies with, consulting with their Game Master
to determine what factions are available in the game's setting and which
would be reasonable for a player in the planned campaign to be a part
of. This faction represents their background, cultural upbringing, or
primary affiliation.</p>
<p>This choice helps inform the character's background and can suggest
appropriate skills and traits. For example, a character from a scholarly
faction might have high <strong>Languages</strong> or <strong>Investigation</strong> skills, while
one from a criminal faction might excel in <strong>Social (Deception)</strong> or
<strong>Physical (Stealth)</strong>.</p>
<p>Players should consult with their Game Master to determine what factions
are appropriate for the story and setting. The GM may have specific
factions in mind for the campaign, or may allow players to propose their
own.</p>
<p>Characters start with a reputation score of 3 with their chosen primary
home faction, representing their familiarity and standing within their
own community. As the character encounters members of other factions
during play, their reputation with those factions will be tracked
separately, starting at 0 for neutral first encounters.</p>
<p>The Game Master should use the expanded faction relationship system
where initial reputation with new factions is determined by the
character's existing relationships. See the Social Relations chapter for
details on this core rule.</p>
