[[file:logic_of_action.svg]]

This section describes the core decision resolution mechanism in OpenAxiom. When a character attempts an action with a meaningful chance of failure, the player and Game Master use the logic of action to determine the outcome. This system provides a consistent framework for resolving uncertainty while maintaining narrative flow.

* Core Mechanic

:ID:       5D8E2F1A-4B9C-3D7E-2F1A-4B9C3D7E2F1A
:END:

The fundamental mechanic in OpenAxiom is rolling 3d6 and comparing the result to a target number. The player rolls 3d6 and sums the results. If the total is less than or equal to the target number, the action succeeds. If the total is greater than the target number, the action fails.

This simple mechanic underlies all character actions in the game. The target number is determined by the character's relevant skill value, modified by situational factors as determined by the Game Master.

* Determining Target Numbers
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7E9F3A2B-5C0D-4E8F-9A3B-6C0D5E9F2A4B
:END:

The base target number for any skill check is the character's skill value. A character with *Piloting (Starship)* at 12 would have a target number of 12 for starship piloting checks.

The Game Master may adjust this target number based on situational factors. These adjustments typically range from -3 to +3, representing extremely easy to extremely difficult circumstances. The following table provides guidelines for determining appropriate modifiers:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class difficulty-modifier-table
| Difficulty        | Modifier | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Very Easy         | +3       | Tasks that should almost always succeed for competent characters. |
| Easy              | +2       | Tasks that are straightforward for characters with relevant skills. |
| Moderate          | +1       | Tasks of average difficulty for characters with relevant skills. |
| Default           | 0        | No modifier for tasks of standard difficulty.            |
| Hard              | -1       | Tasks that challenge even skilled characters.            |
| Very Hard         | -2       | Tasks that are difficult even for experts.               |
| Nearly Impossible | -3       | Tasks that border on the impossible.                     |

* Degrees of Success and Failure
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8F0A4B3C-6D1E-5F9A-0B4C-7D2E6F0A5C8D
:END:

Not all successes and failures are equal. OpenAxiom distinguishes between different degrees of success and failure based on how much the roll deviates from the target number.

#+ATTR_HTML: :class degrees-of-success-table
| Degree of Success/Failure | Roll Result                            | Description                                                                 | GM Guidance |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Critical Success          | 3 or 4                                 | Exceptional performance that exceeds normal capabilities.                  | Narrate as particularly impressive or fortunate outcomes. |
| Exceptional Success       | 5 or more below target number          | Above-average performance.                                                 | May provide minor additional benefits. |
| Marginal Success          | Equal to target or 1-4 below target    | Competent performance that achieves the goal.                              | Standard success with no additional benefits. |
| Marginal Failure          | 1-4 above target number                | Near-success with some positive outcomes despite overall failure.          | May have some positive outcomes despite the overall failure. |
| Exceptional Failure       | 5 or more above target number          | Particularly poor performance.                                             | May have additional negative consequences. |
| Critical Failure          | 17 or 18                               | Catastrophic performance with significant negative effects.                | Narrate as particularly disastrous or unfortunate outcomes. |

** 3d6 Probability Distribution
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6D7E8F9A-0B1C-2D3E-4F5A-6B7C8D9E0F1A
:END:

The 3d6 roll follows a bell curve distribution, with results near the middle (10-11) being most common and results at the extremes (3 and 18) being rare. The table below shows the probability of each possible roll, along with how rolls are categorized relative to a target number of 9:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class probability-table
| Roll | Count | Probability | Category for Target 9   |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------------------|
| 3    | 1     | 0.46%       | Critical Success        |
| 4    | 3     | 1.39%       | Critical Success        |
| 5    | 6     | 2.78%       | Marginal Success        |
| 6    | 10    | 4.63%       | Marginal Success        |
| 7    | 15    | 6.94%       | Marginal Success        |
| 8    | 21    | 9.72%       | Marginal Success        |
| 9    | 25    | 11.57%      | Marginal Success        |
| 10   | 27    | 12.50%      | Marginal Failure        |
| 11   | 27    | 12.50%      | Marginal Failure        |
| 12   | 25    | 11.57%      | Marginal Failure        |
| 13   | 21    | 9.72%       | Exceptional Failure     |
| 14   | 15    | 6.94%       | Exceptional Failure     |
| 15   | 10    | 4.63%       | Exceptional Failure     |
| 16   | 6     | 2.78%       | Exceptional Failure     |
| 17   | 3     | 1.39%       | Critical Failure        |
| 18   | 1     | 0.46%       | Critical Failure        |

With a target number of 9, the probabilities for each degree of success/failure are:
- Critical Success: 1.85%
- Exceptional Success: 0% (for target 9, exceptional successes overlap with critical successes)
- Marginal Success: 35.65%
- Marginal Failure: 36.57%
- Exceptional Failure: 24.07%
- Critical Failure: 1.85%

This distribution shows that for an average skill (target 9), characters will succeed slightly less often than they fail, which creates a good balance of challenge and achievability.

* Opposed Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6A8B1C0D-3E9F-2A6B-9C1D-4E8F3A7B0C2D
:END:

When two characters directly oppose each other in an action, such as in a contest of strength or a race, both characters make skill checks. The character with the higher degree of success wins. If both characters have the same degree of success, the character with the higher skill value wins. If both characters have the same skill value and degree of success, the Game Master may call for additional rolls or determine the outcome narratively.

* Group Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7B9C2D1E-4F0A-3B7C-0D2E-5F9A4B8C1D3E
:END:

When a group of characters works together on a task, the Game Master determines which character has the highest relevant skill. That character makes the primary skill check. Other characters may provide assistance, granting a +1 bonus to the primary character's roll for each assisting character, up to a maximum bonus of +3.

Characters can also work independently on the same task. In this case, each character makes their own skill check. The Game Master determines how the individual results combine to affect the overall outcome.

* Extended Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8C0D3E2F-5A1B-4C8D-1E3F-6A0B5C9D2E4F
:END:

Some tasks require sustained effort over time rather than a single roll. For these extended actions, the Game Master sets a total difficulty value based on the complexity and duration of the task. Characters make repeated skill checks, accumulating successes until they reach the required total. The time between checks and the consequences of failures are determined by the Game Master based on the narrative circumstances.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Elara attempts to pick a lock on a secure door. Her *Physical (Lockpicking)* skill is 11. The Game Master judges the lock to be of average difficulty, so no modifier is applied. Elara's target number is 11.

She rolls 3d6 and gets a 2, 4, and 5 for a total of 11. This is a marginal success. The lock clicks open after a few moments of careful work.

In another situation, Jax needs to hack a corporate security system. His *Computers (Hacking)* skill is 13, but the system is particularly advanced, giving it a -2 difficulty modifier. His target number is 11.

Jax rolls 3d6 and gets a 1, 2, and 2 for a total of 5. This is an exceptional success (6 below his target number). The system is not only hacked but Jax gains additional information about the network that could prove useful later.
