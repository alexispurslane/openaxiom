                <h1 id="1-openaxiom-manual">1. OpenAxiom Manual</h1>
<h2 id="11-introduction">1.1. Introduction</h2>
<p>OpenAxiom is a free and open source, universal tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) engine inspired by GURPS.</p>
<p>OpenAxiom is called a TTRPG "engine," instead of just a TTRPG, because it doesn't come with many of the features you'd expect from a fully-fledged TTRPG, such as lists of predefined gear, monsters, locations, lore, races, classes, skills, traits, and so on. Instead, it's <em>just</em> the core mechanics, designed to be setting and genre agnostic. More importantly, it's a TTRPG <em>engine</em> because it's designed to be a composable, modular, abstract toolkit for simulating any kind of world you want, not a rigid, specific set of rules. Thus, it's an "engine" for creating certain kinds of TTRPGs.</p>
<p>Eventually, modular free and open source "packs" will provide the various other components you need to play, which you can mix and match as needed, although a core pack of sensible skills, traits, and NPCs almost any setting needs is recommended. OpenAxiom is also explicitly designed to be extremely easy to write packs for: the requirements to write a workable pack are minimal, rules are designed to be broadly composable and cross compatible without leading to negative unforeseen consequences, and the toolkit it provides is flexible, easy to understand, and covers a lot of ground. OpenAxiom is also very much inspried by GURPS, so it should also be relatively easy to adapt GURPS sourcebooks to work with it as well, although there are obvious limitations to this, as, for instance, OpenAxiom does not have character attributes such as strength and intelligence, nor many of the other extra crunchy parts of GURPS such as different damage types.</p>
<p>(I actually highly encourage you to go out and buy the GURPS sourcebooks if you can afford them — they're magna opera of nerdy referencework beauty, about all sorts of settings, chock full of fascinating real world information and examples of how to adapt that real world information into beautiful simulationist TTRPG systems and gameplay.)</p>
<p>OpenAxiom is simulationist at its core, meaning that mechanics exist to allow players to directly represent actions and consequences in the game world. It is designed to answer the question "what would happen in this world if…". There are no mechanics for the sake of mechanics, hastily themed after the fact for the sake of gameplay, nor does it provide any metanarrative mechanics. Instead, everything in the game's system should feel like it one to one simulates something going on in the game world and its consequences in a satisfying and specific way. In every case, there should be real payoffs and consequences mechanically determined and mechanically enforced, because the best stories are born from the kind of surprising story generation that can't just be smoothed away in service to convenience or narrative.</p>
<p>Thanks to the fact that all actions have mechanically enforced consequences in OpenAxiom, games in this system often have unavoidable, lasting stakes, and OpenAxiom leans into this by balancing toward the gritty and difficult. Cinematically gritty and difficult, but leaning more towards a gangster movie or <em>Saving Private Ryan</em> than <em>Captain America.</em> This is a game that intends to chew you up and spit you out if you aren't careful. However, nothing is overly random: every outcome is either preventable, something you can prepare for, something you can recover from, or all three. Learn to roll with the punches, embrace the Dwarf Fortress definition of fun, and you'll have a blast.</p>
<p>Importantly, however, to avoid the natural baroque complexity that would result from attempting to be both universal and simulationist, OpenAxiom tries to focus on providing a powerfully abstract toolkit, a <em>logic of action and consequences</em>, instead of trying to provide rules for all specific occasions. It doesn't know, or have to know, about magic or laser blasters. All it knows is how to simulate an attempt to act, and what the results of that action might be. Players assign names to the actions and the outcomes, and compose together different tools within the game's logic of action to construct the specific simulation they need, and then the game processes them as it would any other set of actions and outcomes, producing a result. There's still a direct, one to one correspondence, but it's made in the space between the game and the player, as they assign words to things.</p>
<p>Additionally, the toolkit of rules is designed to be easy to extend with more specific mechanics and mini-games without needing to add contradictions or exceptions to the core rules. All rules are carefully written with the possibility of a potentially infinite number of extensions, extra skills, traits, and so on being in play at the same time in mind, so no assumptions are made about bounded lists, and no other totalizing statements are assumed.</p>
<p>Another difference between OpenAxiom and other TTRPGs is in how its crunch is distributed. Many TTRPGs, even universal ones, spend a lot more time developing combat mechanics than they do social and story mechanics. This is understandable, because developing the former is much easier and more well-understood. But it is also unfortunate, and undermines the supposed universality of the system for players that want to focus on something other than combat. Of course, you can get around this, as GURPS does, by providing a massive ecosystem of extensions and optional rules, which has its own benefits, but the drawback is that it can be very overwhelming, and also difficult to find things. OpenAxiom seeks to provide optional mechanical crunch for everything in its core rulebook, whether it's character development, story beats, social interactions, politics, or combat.</p>
<p>Despite all of the above, a primary goal for OpenAxiom is to be small, easy to read, and easy to understand. For this reason, OpenAxiom attempts to avoid being overly complex by eschewing complex calculations and multidimensional tables. Everything can and should be able to be resolved, no matter how complex the situation, by under five additions or subtractions, and one linear table lookup. (The exception to this is the GM Oracle system, but that's completely optional, usually unnecessary, and unavoidable). Not even any multiplication needed! Similarly, OpenAxiom is exclusively written in a special simple prose designed to be easy for anyone to comprehend.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy playing!</p>
<h2 id="12-table-of-contents">1.2. Table of Contents</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="character_creation.html">Character Creation</a> and <a href="character_mechanics.html">Character Mechanics</a></p>
<p>This section describes what player characters are in OpenAxiom and how to create them. Player characters are defined by skills and traits rather than character classes or traditional attributes. This approach allows for flexible and organic character development, enabling players to build unique individuals. The rules presented here guide the player through each step of character definition, from initial concept to fully-realized character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="core_game_loop.html">Core Game Loop: The Turn System</a></p>
<p>OpenAxiom uses two distinct types of game time to create a dynamic and flexible gameplay experience: tactical time and scene time. These different pacing mechanisms allow the game to shift between intense, structured sequences and free-flowing narrative moments as needed. The transition between tactical and scene time is a binary decision made by the Game Master based on the needs of the narrative and the intensity of the situation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="logic_of_action.html">Logic of Action: Core Decision Resolution Mechanism</a></p>
<p>This section describes the decision resolution mechanism for actions in OpenAxiom. When a character attempts an action with a meaningful chance of failure, the player and Game Master use the logic of action to determine the outcome. This system provides a consistent framework for resolving uncertainty while maintaining narrative flow. The fundamental mechanic is rolling 3d6 and comparing the result to a skill value, modified by some difficulty adjustment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: <a href="combat.html">Combat: The Core Mechanics</a></p>
<p>Combat situations arise naturally in many genres and settings. OpenAxiom recognizes that violence is sometimes necessary in fiction, and that in fact it is often a key aspect of why people enjoy TTRPGs, and so provides optional mechanics that make these scenes engaging and meaningful. The system uses an Ablative Injury System with specific body locations, each with their own pool of Hit Points, and models realistic consequences of violence with the Harm Tracker system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: <a href="social_relations.html">Social Relations: Factions and Reputation</a></p>
<p>Social interactions form a crucial part of many narratives, and OpenAxiom provides a structured system for tracking how characters relate to each other and to various factions. This system adds depth to roleplaying encounters and provides mechanical weight to social dynamics in your game. Characters belong to factions, and each character maintains a reputation rating with every faction they've encountered, which affects social interactions and can change based on successful or failed social skill checks, or specific player actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: <a href="game_mastering.html">Game Mastering and Oracle System</a></p>
<p>This section provides a selection of oracle systems that Game Masters can use as an aid to off-the-cuff improvisation, or which solo players can use as a replacement for a GM entirely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: <a href="channeling.html">Channeling: Extraordinary Abilities Framework</a></p>
<p>Channeling is the universal mechanism for extraordinary abilities in OpenAxiom. This system provides a genre-less and setting-less framework for powers like psionics, magic, nanotech manipulation, reality bending, or quickhacking. The rules for Channeling are designed to be abstract and flexible. This allows Game Masters to adapt them to any setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optional: <a href="advanced.html">Advanced Rules</a></p>
<p>This chapter is a compendium of extra, optional rules to add on to the various modular subsystems of OpenAxiom, for Game Masters who want even more tactical choice, mechanical variety, and simulation.</p>
