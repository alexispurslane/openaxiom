Combat situations arise naturally in many genres and settings. OpenAxiom recognizes that violence is sometimes necessary in fiction, and that in fact it is often a key aspect of why people enjoy TTRPGs, and so provides mechanics that make these scenes engaging and meaningful, providing enough simulationist crunch to add consistent and serious consequences and interesting tactical choices.

At the same time, OpenAxiom recognizes that combat may not be the goal of some tables. As a result, the combat system is designed to be optional, not strictly necessary to character progression or development. Game Masters *may choose to avoid the combat rules entirely if they wish!* These are designed for tables that /like/ combat. If your table wants to focus on narrative, it can simply focus on the core [[file:player_characters.html][player character]] and [[file:logic_of_action.html][logic of action]] rules, using Contested Actions or Contested Extended Actions to simulate combat when needed. This is why the health and body locations system is specified /here/, and not in the player characters section.

When characters enter combat, the game shifts to the Tactical Time turn structure as defined in the [[file:core_game_loop.org][core game loop]]. This shift to Tactical Time is mandatory during combat encounters, ensuring that all actions occur in a consistent and fair sequence. During Tactical Time, each character takes turns performing actions, with initiative determined by relevant skills and traits. This system allows for detailed resolution of combat actions while maintaining the pace and excitement of violent confrontation.

#+ATTR_HTML: :class section-icon
[[file:combat_sequence.svg]]

When characters enter combat, the game shifts to the Tactical Time turn structure as defined in the [[file:core_game_loop.html][core game loop]]. The full sequence of play during a turn in combat is defined there, including how initiative is determined and how players take turns performing actions. This section describes only the sequence of steps required to perform the "Attack" Major Action under Tactical Time. Remember that attacking is just one of many possible Major Actions you can take during your turn in combat.

The sequence of steps required to do the "Attack" Major Action under Tactical Time follows this sequence:

1. *Declare*: The attacker uses their Major Action, specifying their target and the location they are aiming for.

2. *Roll*: The attacker makes their *Combat* skill check. The defender makes a relevant defense check (e.g., *Physical (Dodge)*).

3. *Determine*: The outcome is determined by comparing the Degrees of Success. The attack hits if the attacker achieves a higher degree of success.

4. *Damage*: On a hit, the attacker rolls their weapon's damage.

5. *Armor*: The target subtracts the Damage Resistance (DR) value of the armor covering the specific location hit from the total damage.

6. *Apply*: The final damage is subtracted from the HP of the location that was hit.


* Beyond Attacks: Other Combat Actions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9H8G7F6E-5D4C-3B2A-1Z0Y-9X8W7V6U5T4S
:END:

While the attack sequence focuses on making attacks, combat encounters often involve much more than just hitting opponents. Players can use their Major Actions during combat to perform a wide variety of activities that make sense in the situation.

Examples of other combat actions include:
- Shoving an opponent to push them backward or knock them prone
- Hiding behind cover or ducking behind an obstacle
- Attempting to disarm an opponent's weapon
- Climbing onto a ledge or structure for tactical advantage
- Binding a wound during a lull in the fighting
- Shouting commands to allies or intimidating enemies
- Searching a fallen opponent for items
- Activating a special ability or item

When a player wants to perform an action that isn't covered by the standard attack sequence, they simply describe what they want to do and ask the Game Master. The Game Master will determine what type of skill check is appropriate based on the situation:
- Simple Action: For straightforward tasks that don't require opposition
- Contested Action: For actions that directly oppose another character's efforts
- Extended Action: For tasks that require time and sustained effort
- Contested Extended Action: For ongoing struggles between characters

This approach provides much less to remember than traditional move lists while maintaining the simulational crunch players enjoy. It also allows for greater creativity and flexibility in combat situations, as players aren't limited to a predefined set of actions.


* The Injury System
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       DF92A3CA-A404-4061-80C4-9037838DB7AC
:END:

The injury system determines /what actually happens/ when a character takes damage. It represents different body parts separately, with different mechanical effects as a result of attacking them, to provide more interesting mechanical choices.

** Health & Body Locations
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3A1B2C4D-5E6F-7G8H-9I0J-1K2L3M4N5O6P
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class section-icon
[[file:health_body_locations.svg]]

Characters have six body locations, each with its own pool of Hit Points (HP). HP is calculated from the character's *Physical (Strength)*, *Physical (Endurance)*, *Constitution*, or other skill values, whichever is highest. The difficulty modifier applies to the attacker's combat skill value when targeting that specific location.

#+ATTR_HTML: :class body-location-table
| Body Location | Hit Points Calculation           | Example (Strength 9) | Difficulty Modifier |
|---------------+----------------------------------+----------------------+---------------------|
| Torso         | Full *Physical (Strength)* value | 9 HP                 | +0                  |
| Head          | 1/2 *Physical (Strength)* (round up) | 5 HP             | -3                  |
| Each Arm      | 2/3 *Physical (Strength)* (round up) | 6 HP             | -2                  |
| Each Leg      | 2/3 *Physical (Strength)* (round up) | 6 HP             | -2                  |

The following table provides a quick reference for the HP values of each body location for characters with *Physical (Strength)* skills ranging from 9 to 18. This is purely for convenience; the actual rule is still the calculation in the body part table above.

#+ATTR_HTML: :class hp-lookup-table
| Physical (Strength) | Torso | Head | Each Arm | Each Leg | Total HP |
|---------------------+-------+------+----------+----------+----------|
| 9                   | 9     | 5    | 6        | 6        | 38       |

The following graph visualizes how a character's total HP and HP per body part increase as their *Physical (Strength)* skill improves:

Damage to local HP pools does not immediately do anything. However, over time, as injuries to various parts of the body add up, global effects begin to take place.

*** Crippling Injury
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7O5P6Q8R-9S0T-1U2V-3W4X-5Y6Z7A8B9C0D
:END:

When a location's HP is reduced to **0 or below**, it is Crippled. This has the following effects:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class crippling-injury-table
| Body Location      | Effect on Character                                                                 |
|--------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| General            | When a location is first Crippled, the character's *Physical* Harm Tracker immediately increases by one level. |
| Head               | In addition to the *Physical* Harm, the character's *Mental* Harm Tracker also increases by one level. The character must make an immediate *Physical (Endurance)* check or fall unconscious. |
| Arm (First Crippled) | The character loses access to half of their total inventory slots, rounded up. The player must immediately choose which items to drop. |
| Arm (Second Crippled)| The character's available inventory slots are reduced to 0          |
| Leg (First Crippled) | The character's movement speed is halved.                                          |
| Leg (Second Crippled)| The character's movement speed is reduced to a minimum of 1.                       |

A limb may go into the negative HP levels as well. This does not make the crippling worse, but it can have other consequences, as described in the Systemic Shock section.

*** Critical Success on Attack
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8P6Q7R9S-0T1U-2V3W-4X5Y-6Z7A8B9C0D1E
:END:

When an attacker scores a Critical Success, they deal damage as normal. In addition, the target's *Physical* Harm Tracker immediately increases by one level. This is independent of and can stack with Harm gained from a Crippling Injury on the same attack.

*** Systemic Shock
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9Q7R8S0T-1U2V-3W4X-5Y6Z-7A8B9C0D1E2F
:END:

Systemic shock occurs whenever a character's total HP pool is decreased by another half of their total original HP pool. The character's *Physical* Harm Tracker increases by one level for every half of their total original HP pool that they lose.

For example, a character with average *Physical (Strength)* of 9 would have a total of 38 HP across all locations (9 Torso + 5 Head + 6 Left Arm + 6 Right Arm + 6 Left Leg + 6 Right Leg). This character would experience systemic shock and gain one level on their *Physical* Harm Tracker for every 19 HP they lose from their original total:
- At 38-20 HP remaining (0-18 HP lost): No systemic shock
- At 19-1 HP remaining (19-37 HP lost): First systemic shock (+1 to *Physical* Harm Tracker)
- At 0 HP remaining (38+ HP lost): Second systemic shock (+2 to *Physical* Harm Tracker)

*** Defeat and Death
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0R8S9T1U-2V3W-4X5Y-6Z7A-8B9C0D1E2F3G
:END:

A character is taken out of a fight under the following conditions:

- *Incapacitated*: Their *Physical* Harm Tracker reaches Level 4.

- *Unconscious*: Their Head or Torso is Crippled, and they fail the subsequent *Physical (Endurance)* check.

- *Killed*: Their Head or Torso HP is reduced to a negative value equal to its starting maximum (e.g., -5 HP for a 5 HP Head).

In the former two cases, staying alive becomes an extended action their *Physical (Strength)*: if they succeed, they get to continue being only unconscious until the combat scene ends. If they fail, they die.

The following are an optional toolkit of combat rules that GMs can assemble in order to account for various different situations or preferred combat playstyles, or use as references for designing their own optional combat mechanics for their own setting packs.

** Grappling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1S9T0U2V-3W4X-5Y6Z-7A8B-9C0D1E2F3G4H

#+ATTR_HTML: :class section-icon
[[file:grappling.svg]]

Grappling is a form of unarmed combat that does not deal HP damage. It is a very thin gloss over the existing rules for Contested Extended Actions, showing how existing rules and game systems can be composed together to simulate new situations.

*** Initiating a Grapple
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2T0U1V3W-4X5Y-6Z7A-8B9C-0D1E2F3G4H5I
:END:

A character initiates a grapple using the *Physical (Wrestling)* skill for the initial contested skill check. If the initiating character succeeds, the grapple begins.

*** Maintaining a Grapple & Gaining Control
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3U1V2W4X-5Y6Z-7A8B-9C0D-1E2F3G4H5I6J
:END:

The struggle for control is resolved each turn as described in the rules for Maintaining a Contested Extended Action, using *Physical (Wrestling)* for all contested checks.

When the initiating character wins a contested check, they maintain control of the grapple and may choose to apply one of the following effects to the opponent:

- *Immobilize a Limb*: The initiator gains control over one of the opponent's arms or legs. This has the same mechanical effect as crippling the limb (inventory loss for an arm, halved movement for a leg) for the duration of the grapple. The initiator may switch which limb is immobilized on subsequent successful checks.

- *Control the Torso (Pin)*: After successfully immobilizing at least one limb on a previous turn, the initiator can use a subsequent successful check to gain control of the opponent's torso. The opponent is now Pinned. A Pinned character is fully immobilized and may only take the contested action to break the grapple on their turn.

*** Ending a Grapple
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4V2W3X5Y-6Z7A-8B9C-0D1E-2F3G4H5I6J7K
:END:

A grapple ends immediately under the conditions specified in the Contested Extended Action rules:

- *Break Free*: The opponent wins a contested check to "enter the contest," breaking free and gaining *Momentum*.
- *Release*: The initiating character chooses not to maintain the grapple on their turn.

** Spatial Relations
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5W3X4Y6Z-7A8B-9C0D-1E2F-3G4H5I6J7K8L
:END:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class section-icon
[[file:spatial_relations.svg]]

More advanced players who want more interesting tactical opportunities may introduce a hexagonal grid when players enter combat to structure character, NPC, and enemy spatial relations. This optional system adds tactical depth by making positioning and movement important factors in combat. This set of rules is an example of how totally new dimensions of combat can be modularly added to the game and well-integrated with existing systems.

*** Setting Up the Battlefield
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6X4Y5Z7A-8B9C-0D1E-2F3G-4H5I6J7K8L9M
:END:

All players must start wherever the Game Master decides they should start on the grid. The Game Master also places all non-player characters and enemies on the grid according to the tactical situation. Each hex on the map can be one of several terrain types, each with different properties:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class terrain-types-table
| Terrain Type      | Movement Cost      | Combat Effects                            | Description                                               |
|-------------------+--------------------+-------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Floor             | Normal             | None                                      | Standard terrain with no special properties               |
| Wall              | Impassable         | Blocks movement and line of sight         | Solid barriers that cannot be moved through               |
| Difficult Terrain | +1 to +3 movement  | As determined by the Game Master          | Environmental features like trees, bushes, water, etc.    |
| High Ground       | Normal             | +1 to +3 bonus to ranged combat skills    | Elevated positions that grant tactical advantages         |
| Cover             | Normal             | -1 penalty to ranged attacks through it   | Provides partial protection without blocking movement or line of sight |
| Unstable Terrain  | Normal             | Requires Physical (Acrobatics) check to avoid falling prone | Surfaces that are slippery, loose, or otherwise unstable. The Physical (Acrobatics) check must be made whenever a character moves into a hex of this type. |
| Damaging Terrain  | Normal             | Causes fixed HP damage to both legs       | Surfaces that cause damage. Fixed HP damage is applied to both legs whenever a character moves into a hex of this type. |

Note that posture and cover penalties stack. For example, a character laying down (-2 penalty) behind cover (-1 penalty) would have a total -3 penalty to ranged attacks targeting them.

Specific examples of all types of terrain (both special and not) are determined automatically by the setting and location, but all conceivable types of gameplay-relevant terrain should fall into one of these categories.

*** Posture System
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       9A7B8C0D-1E2F-3G4H-5I6J-7K8L9M0N1O2P
:END:

Characters can adopt different postures during combat to gain defensive advantages at the cost of mobility. The posture system provides tactical options for players who want to trade movement for protection:

#+ATTR_HTML: :class posture-system-table
| Posture      | Movement Restriction            | Ranged Combat Defense Bonus | Description                                               |
|--------------+---------------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Standing     | Normal movement                 | None                        | Standard posture with no restrictions or bonuses          |
| Crouching    | Only one hex per turn           | -1 modifier to hit          | Lower profile provides minor protection against ranged attacks |
| Laying Down  | Cannot move                     | -2 modifier to hit          | Maximum protection against ranged attacks at the cost of mobility |

Characters can change their posture as a minor action on their turn. This allows them to adapt their tactics based on the current situation, such as taking cover when under heavy ranged fire or standing up to move more freely.

*** Movement
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7Y5Z6A8B-9C0D-1E2F-3G4H-5I6J7K8L9M0N
:END:

Players may move up to their best fleetness/quickness related *Physical* skill minus 5 (minimum of 1) as their movement action. Movement is considered a minor action on their turn, allowing characters to still take a major action for attacking or other activities. Moving through difficult terrain costs additional movement points as determined by the terrain table above.

*** Line of Sight
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8Z6A7B9C-0D1E-2F3G-4H5I-6J7K8L9M0N1O
:END:

Players who use ranged weapons must have a *line of sight* to the opponents they wish to attack. Only walls block movement and line of sight. Trees, bushes, and other environmental features count as walls in outdoor settings for the purpose of blocking line of sight. Characters can see and attack through other characters, but must make an extra skill check against their combat skill to succeed.

*** Flanking
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       7A8B9C0D-1E2F-3G4H-5I6J-7K8L9M0N1O2P
:END:

When attacking an enemy in melee combat, positioning can provide significant tactical advantages. If one or more of a character's allies are adjacent to an enemy that the character is attacking, this is considered *flanking*.

Flanking provides the following benefits:
- The attacking character receives a +1 bonus to all attack skill checks against the flanked enemy
- The flanked enemy receives a -1 penalty to all of their attack skill checks

Flanking represents the tactical advantage of having multiple attackers positioned around an enemy, making it difficult for the target to defend against attacks from multiple directions simultaneously. This bonus applies to all melee attacks, and the penalty applies to all attacks made by the flanked character until the flanking conditions change (either the allies move away or the target moves).

*** Range

Any ranged item designed to be used with the spatial relations rules should come with a specified range. Players only need line of sight and a successful skill check to hit something within the range of their ranged weapon. *For targets beyond the weapon's range, players get a -1 penalty to their skill check for every hex beyond their range they aim.*
