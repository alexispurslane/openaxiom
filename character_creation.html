                <h1 id="2-character-creation">2. Character Creation</h1>
<p>This document is the guide for "Session Zero." It contains everything a player needs to build a character from concept to completion.</p>
<h2 id="21-biography">2.1. Biography</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="static/biography.svg" /></p>
<p>Every character needs a biography first. This biography consists of two freeform fields: Appearance and History. These descriptions are crucial for defining a character's identity. Players should carefully consider their character's appearance and history when selecting skills and traits. The biography helps to ensure a character's mechanical representation aligns with their narrative concept.</p>
<h3 id="211-appearance">2.1.1. Appearance</h3>
<p>This field describes what a character looks like. It covers physical features, clothing, and any other visual characteristics. An appearance description can suggest certain skills or traits. For example, a character described as "exceptionally tall and gaunt" might have a high skill in <strong>Stealth</strong> or a trait representing <strong>Frail Constitution</strong>. A "heavily muscled individual with calloused hands" might have high <strong>Strength</strong> or a trait for <strong>Powerful Build</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="212-history">2.1.2. History</h3>
<p>This field outlines a character's past experiences and background. It can include significant life events, training, or personal struggles. A character's history directly informs their skill and trait selection. For example, a "former deep-space miner" might have high <strong>Piloting (Mining Vessels)</strong> or a trait for <strong>Claustrophobia</strong>. A "childhood spent studying ancient languages" could lead to high <strong>Linguistics</strong> or a trait for <strong>Bookish</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="22-character-points-pool">2.2. Character Points Pool</h2>
<p>Now that your character has an appearance and backstory, it's time to choose <strong>skills</strong> and <strong>traits</strong>, which are the main <em>mechanical</em> features of a character in OpenAxiom. Yes, that's right: not only does OpenAxiom not have character races or classes, it <strong>entirely lacks character attributes</strong> (such as STR, DEX, INT, etc) too!</p>
<p>OpenAxiom uses a point-based character creation system for determining a character's starting skills and traits. Each player starts with a pool of character points, which represents the default human level of capability. The Game Master may adjust this pool up or down depending on the campaign's power level, typically ranging from 3-7 points, with 5 representing the average capabilities of an average human.</p>
<p>Character points can be spent in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Increasing skills</strong> above the default value of 9 (costs 1 point per skill level above 9, unlike <em>story points</em>, which are used to upgrade characters after creation, and have an increasing cost curve)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purchasing positive traits</strong> (costs 1 point per trait level)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Purchasing negative traits</strong> (gains 1 point per trait level)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Skills, positive traits, and negative traits all cost points at a 1:1 ratio, making them equally valuable in character creation. They are chosen from lists provided by the GM for the setting, genre, and tone of the campaign. Players can spend multiple character points on a single skill to increase it by more than one level. However, players may not reduce skills below the default value of 9 to gain additional character points. This prevents players from creating dump stats to gain an excessive number of character points.</p>
<p><strong>Each chosen skill, positive trait, and negative trait must be justified by a one-sentence appeal to the character's Appearance and History sections.</strong></p>
<p>For example, a player with 5 character points could:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Buy a skill at 14 (costs 5 points), using all 5 points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or buy a skill at 12 (costs 3 points) and a +2 positive trait (costs 2 points), using all 5 points</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or buy a skill at 11 (costs 2 points), a +2 positive trait (costs 2 points), and a -3 negative trait (gains 3 points), leaving 4 points for a very big positive trait</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or distribute points across many smaller improvements</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Ben wants to create a brilliant but frail academic. Starting with 5 Character Points, he decides to lean into this concept. To represent his character's physical weakness, he takes the <strong>Frail</strong> negative trait at a value of -4. This immediately gives him 4 extra CP, boosting his pool to a total of 9. He then invests heavily in his character's intellect, spending 5 CP to raise his <strong>Investigation</strong> skill from 9 to a formidable 14. With his remaining 4 CP, he purchases the <strong>Photographic Memory</strong> positive trait at +4, perfectly capturing the image of a scholar with a mind like a steel trap but a body like glass.
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="23-skills">2.3. Skills</h2>
<p>A skill represents anything a character can do or be. This includes physical abilities like strength or swimming, and mental aptitudes such as various forms of intelligence. Skills are trainable, meaning a character's proficiency can improve over time. Skills have a name, indicating the scope and applicability of the skill, and a numerical value, indicating the character's proficiency with it. Any <em>general</em> skill not explicitly listed on a character's sheet has the default value of 9 (for more on this, see <a href="character_mechanics.html">Character Mechanics</a>).</p>
<p>Effective skill values (which are a combination of skill values, trait values, and any other bonuses or penalties in play) in OpenAxiom are theoretically infinite, but a player's actual skill value must range from 0 to 28, representing the full spectrum of capability in a 3d6 ± 10 system. All skills start at the default value of 9. Players can increase skills above 9 using their character points, but cannot decrease skills below 9 to gain additional points, although skills may be reduced below 9 by negative traits.</p>
<p>Players may choose specific skills without choosing the more general version. For example, a character can have <strong>Piloting (Starship)</strong> without having <strong>Piloting</strong>. When a character has a specific skill but not its more general version, they can only use that specific skill for tasks that match it exactly, or are sub-specialties of it (such as <strong>Piloting (Starship) (Freighter)</strong>). They cannot use it as a substitute for other specializations of the same general skill, or for the general skill itself.</p>
<p>The Game Master provides a list of skills that are available in their game world. Players must always use the most specific applicable skill from this list when making skill checks. For example, if a GM's list includes both <strong>Physical (Stealth)</strong> and <strong>Physical (Stealth) (Urban)</strong>, and a character is attempting to hide in an urban environment, they must use <strong>Physical (Stealth) (Urban)</strong> rather than the more general <strong>Physical (Stealth)</strong> skill.</p>
<h2 id="24-trait-selection">2.4. Trait Selection</h2>
<p>During character creation, players may also use their character points pool to purchase positive and negative traits from lists provided by the Game Master. Traits represent inherent skills, talents, or aptitudes your character may have.</p>
<h3 id="241-trait-values">2.4.1. Trait Values</h3>
<p>All traits are inherently either <strong>positive</strong> (a boost) or <strong>negative</strong> (a hindrance). However, <strong>traits do not have an inherent value by default.</strong></p>
<p>Instead, players choose the value of each trait they want to take (known as the <strong>trait level</strong>), and then spend or gain that many character points accordingly. For positive traits, the player chooses a value and spends that many character points from their pool. For negative traits, the player chooses a value and gains that many character points to their pool.</p>
<p>Each chosen trait must be justified by a one-sentence appeal to the character's Appearance and History sections, just like with skills.</p>
<h3 id="242-trait-categories">2.4.2. Trait Categories</h3>
<p>Traits are divided into four categories that determine how and when they apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Broad Traits</strong>: Affect entire skill categories (like all <strong>Social</strong> skills) and represent fundamental aspects of your character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narrow Traits</strong>: Affect specific skills (like just <strong>Art (Music)</strong>) and represent specialized talents or limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Situational Traits</strong>: Only apply under specific conditions (like in darkness or extreme cold).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Special Traits</strong>: Add unique game rules beyond simple bonuses, such as special abilities or rerolls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="243-skills-versus-traits">2.4.3. Skills Versus Traits</h3>
<p>There are several important tradeoffs between skills and traits. The following table summarizes the key differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Aspect</th>
<th>Skills</th>
<th>Traits</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Improvement</td>
<td>Can change and improve over time</td>
<td>Static and cannot be improved</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scope</td>
<td>Affects only the specific skill</td>
<td>Can apply to many skills at once</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Maximum Value</td>
<td>28</td>
<td>Traits stack even on top of maximum-valued skills for a larger effective skill value, so the maximum value of a skill via traits is 33</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bonus Size</td>
<td>Can give a much larger bonus in particular skills (up to +9)</td>
<td>Capped at +5 per trait, and only the highest trait bonus applies</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Special Effects</td>
<td>Simple numerical bonuses</td>
<td>Can introduce new rules and special abilities</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative Effects</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>Can impose penalties or limitations, but gain you CP in return</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Moreover, while positive skill improvement can overcome negative traits to a certain degree, skill values cap out eventually, meaning that characters with negative traits will not only start out with a disadvantage, but also eventually fall behind those without such traits who can reach the full cap without a negative modifier. Additionally, extra points must be spent to overcome a trait, that other characters could instead spend on other things, or spend on improving the relevant skills faster. This means that negative traits create a permanent disadvantage that becomes more pronounced at the extremes of character development, and is also visible in character progression. Therefore, it is recommended to work <em>with</em> negative traits, not against them.</p>
<p>For example, a character with a trait that applies a -5 penalty to <strong>Mental (Reasoning)</strong> can spend all their available character points (5 CP gained from the negative trait + the 5 starting CP) to increase that skill to 19, but it will effectively be only 14 thanks to the negative trait, whereas a character with no such disability can reach 14 just by directly spending the points. So pushing back on the trait essentially wastes character points undoing the effect of the trait. Moreover, at the high end, a character with such a negative trait could reach a skill value of 28, but the effective skill value would only be 23, whereas a character without such a negative trait could reach 28, and a character with a positive trait could reach 33.</p>
<h3 id="244-traits-and-lore-items">2.4.4. Traits and Lore Items</h3>
<p>Some traits may come with associated lore items that a character must carry with them as a result of having that trait. These items are typically Small or Medium in size and don't confer mechanical advantages beyond what the trait itself provides. For example, a character with the <strong>Photographic Memory</strong> trait might carry a cybernetic implant, or a character with <strong>Night Vision</strong> might have special eye drops or wear tinted glasses. These items are considered part of the character's backstory and serve to reinforce the narrative justification for the trait.</p>
<p>Lore items associated with traits are automatically provided to characters during character creation and do not count against their inventory slot limits. However, they can be lost or damaged during play, potentially affecting the character's ability to use their trait effectively until the item is replaced.</p>
<h2 id="25-item-selection">2.5. Item Selection</h2>
<p>During character creation, characters start with all items required by their skills, plus any worldbuilding or lore items they want, as long as those don't confer a mechanical advantage.</p>
<p>Your best strength-related skill determines the number of inventory slots you have available to carry items. Strength-related skills include <strong>Physical (Strength)</strong>, <strong>Physical (Endurance)</strong>, and any other skills that the Game Master deems appropriate for determining carrying capacity.</p>
<p>Items are categorized into four size classes that determine how they consume inventory slots:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Small</strong> (S): These items can be fit two per inventory slot (e.g., a dagger, a book, a small tool).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Medium</strong> (M): These items require one inventory slot (e.g., a sword, a backpack, a rope).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Large</strong> (L): These items require two inventory slots (e.g., a suit of armor, a large weapon, a chest).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extra Large</strong> (XL): These items require multiple players to carry, with each participant using all of their open slots for the duration (e.g., a canoe, a large piece of furniture, a heavy statue).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This information helps you understand how many items your character can realistically carry when selecting starting equipment.</p>
<h2 id="26-factions">2.6. Factions</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="static/factions.svg" /></p>
<p>During character creation, players should consider which faction their character primarily identifies with, consulting with their Game Master to determine what factions are available in the game's setting and which would be reasonable for a player in the planned campaign to be a part of. This faction represents their background, cultural upbringing, or primary affiliation.</p>
<p>This choice helps inform the character's background and can suggest appropriate skills and traits. For example, a character from a scholarly faction might have high <strong>Languages</strong> or <strong>Investigation</strong> skills, while one from a criminal faction might excel in <strong>Social (Deception)</strong> or <strong>Physical (Stealth)</strong>.</p>
<p>Characters start with a reputation score of 3 with their chosen primary home faction, representing their familiarity and standing within their own community. As the character encounters members of other factions during play, their reputation with those factions will be tracked separately, starting at 0 for neutral first encounters.</p>
<p>The Game Master should use the expanded faction relationship system where initial reputation with new factions is determined by the character's existing relationships. See the <a href="social_relations.html">Social Relations chapter</a> for details on this core rule.</p>
<h2 id="27-full-walkthrough-example-creating-jax">2.7. Full Walkthrough Example: Creating Jax</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Sarah sits down for Session Zero, eager to create her character for the GM's new cyberpunk campaign. She has a concept in mind: a street-level courier who is fast and clever, but haunted by a past brush with faulty cybernetics.</p>
<p><strong>1. Biography</strong></p>
<p>First, she breathes life into her character, Jax, by defining his story.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appearance:</strong> She pictures him clearly: "Jax is a lanky man in his late twenties, with a mess of dark hair that's perpetually damp with rain or sweat. His face is sharp and angular, but his most notable features are his cybernetic eyes, which glow with a faint blue light, and the worn, synth-leather duster he always wears to hide the cheap chrome of his prosthetic left arm."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>History:</strong> She writes a backstory to anchor his skills and fears: "Jax grew up an orphan on the neon-drenched streets of Neo-Kyoto, making a living by running data and contraband for minor league gangs. A botched delivery job cost him his arm and nearly his life. He was saved by a back-alley cyber-doc who replaced the limb with a clunky, second-hand prosthetic. The experience left him with a deep-seated fear of faulty technology and a determination to get by on his wits and reflexes, rather than trusting in implants that could fail him again."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Allocating Character Points</strong></p>
<p>The GM has given everyone a pool of 5 Character Points (CP). Sarah plans how to spend them to reflect Jax's history.</p>
<p><strong>3. Justifying Skills &amp; Traits</strong></p>
<p>Sarah selects Jax's abilities, providing a one-sentence justification for each, directly tying them to his biography.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, she decides Jax's life as a courier made him an expert at avoiding notice. She spends 3 of her 5 CP to raise his <strong>Physical (Stealth)</strong> from the default 9 to 12.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justification:</strong> "His history as a street runner and contraband courier required him to know how to move unseen through the city's underbelly."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, she spends her last 2 CP to reflect his silver tongue, increasing his <strong>Social (Deception)</strong> from 9 to 11.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justification:</strong> "Living on the streets, Jax had to lie constantly to clients, rivals, and law enforcement to survive."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To get more points and deepen his character, she chooses a negative trait. The <strong>Broad, Situational</strong> trait <strong>Technophobia</strong> at a -3 value feels perfect.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justification:</strong> "His history of losing his arm to a botched job and being fitted with a cheap, unreliable prosthetic has given him a profound distrust and fear of complex tech."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, she spends those 3 points on a positive trait reflecting his cyber-eyes. She chooses the <strong>Narrow</strong> trait <strong>Keen Eyesight</strong> at a +3 value.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Justification:</strong> "His appearance notes his advanced cybernetic eyes, which would logically grant him superior vision for spotting details others might miss."
<br/></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Final Touches</strong></p>
<p>Jax automatically starts with his worn duster and a cheap data-slate as lore items. His highest strength-related skill is <strong>Physical</strong> (default 9), granting him 9 inventory slots. For his faction, Sarah and the GM agree he belongs to the "Street Runners," giving him an initial reputation of 3 with his peers. Jax is ready to hit the streets of Neo-Kyoto.
