#+OPTIONS: H:7

OpenAxiom uses two distinct types of game time to create a dynamic and flexible gameplay experience: tactical time and scene time. These different pacing mechanisms allow the game to shift between intense, structured sequences and free-flowing narrative moments as needed.

The transition between tactical and scene time is a binary decision made by the Game Master based on the needs of the narrative and the intensity of the situation.

* Units of Time

:END:

There are five main units of time in OpenAxiom. Here they are, in order of granularity:

1. *Turn*: a unit of time comprising a single major and minor action (as well as any roleplaying) a player takes before other players get to chime in.
2. *Round*: a unit of time comprising one iteration through each player (and NPC and enemy) getting their turn.
3. *Scene*: a continuous period of gameplay that uses a single type of time. A new scene begins whenever the Game Master switches between tactical time and scene time. For example, an entire combat encounter run using tactical time is one scene. The period of free-flowing roleplaying that happens in scene time right after that combat is another scene.
4. *Session*: a session of play for the day/week/month.
5. *Campaign*: a full narrative with a beginning, middle, and end, composed of sessions.

* Tactical Time
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5E377D55-0BA8-4998-92B9-DB7FD43B76A4
:END:

Tactical time is used during combat encounters, chases, or any situation where precise timing and turn order are important. During tactical time, all participants (players, NPCs, and enemies) take turns in a specific order determined by initiative rolls.

** Initiative
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       A65BC4DE-FE33-4451-809E-2D3D67C75106
:END:

At the start of tactical time, all participants roll 3d6. Turns are taken in order from lowest to highest roll. In the case of ties, participants with the same roll go in clockwise order from the Game Master.

Each full cycle through all participants constitutes one round of tactical time. Participants retain their initiative order throughout the encounter unless specific game effects modify it.

** Actions on Your Turn
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       D9904D92-13B5-401B-940C-DC165C8D378A
:END:

During their turn, each participant can take one major action and one minor action:

1. Major Actions
   1. Major actions are significant activities that require focus, effort, or skill
   2. They typically involve making a skill check and include:
      1. Attacking an opponent
      2. Using a skill that requires a check
      3. Activating a special ability
      4. Casting a spell or using advanced technology
      5. Performing a complex task

2. Minor Actions
   1. Minor actions are simpler activities that can be performed alongside a major action
   2. These include:
      1. Moving up to their normal movement speed
      2. Speaking a few words or short phrases
      3. Interacting with a mundane object (opening a door, picking up an item)
      4. Taking cover or changing position
      5. Dropping an item or drawing a readily accessible item

** Triggers
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6192CD0A-BB7F-4314-B627-46417215034A
:END:

Players can specify triggers for their major and minor actions. A trigger is an if-else condition where if the condition is met, the player's character takes an action before anyone else can act.

1. Examples of triggers:
   1. "If an enemy moves within 10 meters, I shoot at them"
   2. "If I take damage, I drop prone for cover"
   3. "If someone tries to pickpocket me, I grab their hand"

2. When multiple trigger actions are activated simultaneously:
   1. They resolve in the order they were specified to the Game Master

* Scene Time
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       075852A3-0596-4434-86BB-C26EB6579444
:END:

Scene time is used for exploration, roleplaying, investigation, and other non-combat situations. During scene time, gameplay is completely free-flowing:

1. Players act when they want to act
2. There is no turn order or initiative
3. Players can take as many actions as appropriate to the narrative
4. The Game Master manages the flow of events and time naturally

Scene time is ideal for conversations, exploration, research, and other activities where the structured pace of tactical time would be unnecessarily restrictive.

* Rests
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       3F8A4B7E-9C2D-4E6F-A1B2-C3D4E5F6G7H8
:END:

Rests represent periods when characters take time to recover from exertion, heal injuries, and restore their mental and physical well-being. The Game Master decides when rests occur based on the narrative flow and the characters' needs.

Rests can only happen during scene time. This means that characters cannot rest during active combat encounters or other situations requiring tactical time. The Game Master may call for a rest when:

1. Characters have had a particularly challenging encounter or series of encounters
2. The narrative naturally provides a safe space for recovery
3. Characters express a need to recuperate from injuries or exhaustion
4. A significant amount of time has passed in the game world

During a rest, characters may recover from harm through natural recovery methods. A character can reduce one harm tracker by one level whenever they get adequate long rest and recuperation, allowing their body, mind, or social standing to heal naturally.

The Game Master determines the specific benefits of a rest based on its duration and conditions. A brief respite might provide minor benefits, while an extended period of rest in comfortable conditions could provide more substantial recovery.
