Introduction OpenAxiom is a free and open source, universal tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) engine inspired by GURPS. OpenAxiom is called a TTRPG \"engine,\" instead of just a TTRPG, because it doesn't come with many of the features you'd expect from a fully-fledged TTRPG, such as lists of predefined gear, monsters, locations, lore, races, classes, skills, traits, and so on. Instead, it's just the core mechanics, designed to be setting and genre agnostic. More importantly, it's a TTRPG engine because it's designed to be a composable, modular, abstract toolkit for simulating any kind of world you want, not a rigid, specific set of rules. Thus, it's an \"engine\" for creating certain kinds of TTRPGs. Eventually, modular free and open source \"packs\" will provide the various other components you need to play, which you can mix and match as needed, although a core pack of sensible skills, traits, and NPCs almost any setting needs is recommended. OpenAxiom is also explicitly designed to be extremely easy to write packs for: the requirements to write a workable pack are minimal, rules are designed to be broadly composable and cross compatible without leading to negative unforeseen consequences, and the toolkit it provides is flexible, easy to understand, and covers a lot of ground. OpenAxiom is also very much inspried by GURPS, so it should also be relatively easy to adapt GURPS sourcebooks to work with it as well, although there are obvious limitations to this, as, for instance, OpenAxiom does not have character attributes such as strength and intelligence, nor many of the other extra crunchy parts of GURPS such as different damage types. (I actually highly encourage you to go out and buy the GURPS sourcebooks if you can afford them \u2014 they're magna opera of nerdy referencework beauty, about all sorts of settings, chock full of fascinating real world information and examples of how to adapt that real world information into beautiful simulationist TTRPG systems and gameplay.) OpenAxiom is simulationist at its core, meaning that mechanics exist to allow players to directly represent actions and consequences in the game world. It is designed to answer the question \"what would happen in this world if\u2026\". There are no mechanics for the sake of mechanics, hastily themed after the fact for the sake of gameplay, nor does it provide any metanarrative mechanics. Instead, everything in the game's system should feel like it one to one simulates something going on in the game world and its consequences in a satisfying and specific way. In every case, there should be real payoffs and consequences mechanically determined and mechanically enforced, because the best stories are born from the kind of surprising story generation that can't just be smoothed away in service to convenience or narrative. Thanks to the fact that all actions have mechanically enforced consequences in OpenAxiom, games in this system often have unavoidable, lasting stakes, and OpenAxiom leans into this by balancing toward the gritty and difficult. Cinematically gritty and difficult, but leaning more towards a gangster movie or Saving Private Ryan than Captain America. This is a game that intends to chew you up and spit you out if you aren't careful. However, nothing is overly random: every outcome is either preventable, something you can prepare for, something you can recover from, or all three. Learn to roll with the punches, embrace the Dwarf Fortress definition of fun, and you'll have a blast. Importantly, however, to avoid the natural baroque complexity that would result from attempting to be both universal and simulationist, OpenAxiom tries to focus on providing a powerfully abstract toolkit, a logic of action and consequences , instead of trying to provide rules for all specific occasions. It doesn't know, or have to know, about magic or laser blasters. All it knows is how to simulate an attempt to act, and what the results of that action might be. Players assign names to the actions and the outcomes, and compose together different tools within the game's logic of action to construct the specific simulation they need, and then the game processes them as it would any other set of actions and outcomes, producing a result. There's still a direct, one to one correspondence, but it's made in the space between the game and the player, as they assign words to things. Additionally, the toolkit of rules is designed to be easy to extend with more specific mechanics and mini-games without needing to add contradictions or exceptions to the core rules. All rules are carefully written with the possibility of a potentially infinite number of extensions, extra skills, traits, and so on being in play at the same time in mind, so no assumptions are made about bounded lists, and no other totalizing statements are assumed. Another difference between OpenAxiom and other TTRPGs is in how its crunch is distributed. Many TTRPGs, even universal ones, spend a lot more time developing combat mechanics than they do social and story mechanics. This is understandable, because developing the former is much easier and more well-understood. But it is also unfortunate, and undermines the supposed universality of the system for players that want to focus on something other than combat. Of course, you can get around this, as GURPS does, by providing a massive ecosystem of extensions and optional rules, which has its own benefits, but the drawback is that it can be very overwhelming, and also difficult to find things. OpenAxiom seeks to provide optional mechanical crunch for everything in its core rulebook, whether it's character development, story beats, social interactions, politics, or combat. Despite all of the above, a primary goal for OpenAxiom is to be small, easy to read, and easy to understand. For this reason, OpenAxiom attempts to avoid being overly complex by eschewing complex calculations and multidimensional tables. Everything can and should be able to be resolved, no matter how complex the situation, by under five additions or subtractions, and one linear table lookup. (The exception to this is the GM Oracle system, but that's completely optional, usually unnecessary, and unavoidable). Not even any multiplication needed! Similarly, OpenAxiom is exclusively written in a special simple prose designed to be easy for anyone to comprehend. We hope you enjoy playing! 1.2. Table of Contents Character Creation and Character Mechanics This section describes what player characters are in OpenAxiom and how to create them. Player characters are defined by skills and traits rather than character classes or traditional attributes. This approach allows for flexible and organic character development, enabling players to build unique individuals. The rules presented here guide the player through each step of character definition, from initial concept to fully-realized character. Core Game Loop: The Turn System OpenAxiom uses two distinct types of game time to create a dynamic and flexible gameplay experience: tactical time and scene time. These different pacing mechanisms allow the game to shift between intense, structured sequences and free-flowing narrative moments as needed. The transition between tactical and scene time is a binary decision made by the Game Master based on the needs of the narrative and the intensity of the situation. Logic of Action: Core Decision Resolution Mechanism This section describes the decision resolution mechanism for actions in OpenAxiom. When a character attempts an action with a meaningful chance of failure, the player and Game Master use the logic of action to determine the outcome. This system provides a consistent framework for resolving uncertainty while maintaining narrative flow. The fundamental mechanic is rolling 3d6 and comparing the result to a skill value, modified by some difficulty adjustment. Optional: Combat: The Core Mechanics Combat situations arise naturally in many genres and settings. OpenAxiom recognizes that violence is sometimes necessary in fiction, and that in fact it is often a key aspect of why people enjoy TTRPGs, and so provides optional mechanics that make these scenes engaging and meaningful. The system uses an Ablative Injury System with specific body locations, each with their own pool of Hit Points, and models realistic consequences of violence with the Harm Tracker system. Optional: Social Relations: Factions and Reputation Social interactions form a crucial part of many narratives, and OpenAxiom provides a structured system for tracking how characters relate to each other and to various factions. This system adds depth to roleplaying encounters and provides mechanical weight to social dynamics in your game. Characters belong to factions, and each character maintains a reputation rating with every faction they've encountered, which affects social interactions and can change based on successful or failed social skill checks, or specific player actions. Optional: Game Mastering and Oracle System This section provides a selection of oracle systems that Game Masters can use as an aid to off-the-cuff improvisation, or which solo players can use as a replacement for a GM entirely. Optional: Channeling: Extraordinary Abilities Framework Channeling is the universal mechanism for extraordinary abilities in OpenAxiom. This system provides a genre-less and setting-less framework for powers like psionics, magic, nanotech manipulation, reality bending, or quickhacking. The rules for Channeling are designed to be abstract and flexible. This allows Game Masters to adapt them to any setting. Optional: Advanced Rules This chapter is a compendium of extra, optional rules to add on to the various modular subsystems of OpenAxiom, for Game Masters who want even more tactical choice, mechanical variety, and simulation. 1.3.

Appendix I - Advanced Rules This chapter is a compendium of extra, optional rules to add on to the various modular subsystems of OpenAxiom, for Game Masters who want even more tactical choice, mechanical variety, and simulation. 10.1. Advanced Combat Rules The following are an optional toolkit of combat rules that GMs can assemble in order to account for various different situations or preferred combat playstyles, or use as references for designing their own optional combat mechanics for their own setting packs. 10.1.1. Spatial Relations More advanced players who want more interesting tactical opportunities may introduce a hexagonal grid when players enter combat to structure character, NPC, and enemy spatial relations. This optional system adds tactical depth by making positioning and movement important factors in combat. This set of rules is an example of how totally new dimensions of combat can be modularly added to the game and well-integrated with existing systems. 10.1.1.1. Setting Up the Battlefield In hex-based tactical combat, the battlefield is divided into hexagonal tiles, with each tile representing a specific type of terrain. Players, NPCs, and enemies are represented by counters or miniatures that are placed on these hex tiles. Each hex tile has a terrain type that affects movement costs and combat, as detailed in the terrain table below. All players must start wherever the Game Master decides they should start on the grid. The Game Master also places all non-player characters and enemies on the grid according to the tactical situation. Each hex on the map can be one of several terrain types, each with different properties: Terrain Type Movement Cost Combat Effects Description Floor Normal None Standard terrain with no special properties Wall Impassable Blocks movement and line of sight Solid barriers that cannot be moved through Difficult Terrain +1 to +3 movement As determined by the Game Master Environmental features like trees, bushes, water, etc. High Ground Normal +1 to +3 bonus to ranged combat skills Elevated positions that grant tactical advantages Cover Normal -1 penalty to ranged attacks through it Provides partial protection without blocking movement or line of sight Unstable Terrain Normal Requires Physical (Acrobatics) check to avoid falling prone Surfaces that are slippery, loose, or otherwise unstable. The Physical (Acrobatics) check must be made whenever a character moves into a hex of this type. Damaging Terrain Normal Causes fixed HP damage to both legs Surfaces that cause damage. Fixed HP damage is applied to both legs whenever a character moves into a hex of this type. Note that posture and cover penalties stack. For example, a character laying down (-2 penalty) behind cover (-1 penalty) would have a total -3 penalty to ranged attacks targeting them. Specific examples of all types of terrain (both special and not) are determined automatically by the setting and location, but all conceivable types of gameplay-relevant terrain should fall into one of these categories. 10.1.1.2. Posture System Characters can adopt different postures during combat to gain defensive advantages at the cost of mobility. The posture system provides tactical options for players who want to trade movement for protection: Posture Movement Restriction Ranged Combat Defense Bonus Description Standing Normal movement None Standard posture with no restrictions or bonuses Crouching Only one hex per turn -1 modifier to hit Lower profile provides minor protection against ranged attacks Laying Down Cannot move -2 modifier to hit Maximum protection against ranged attacks at the cost of mobility Characters can change their posture as a minor action on their turn. This allows them to adapt their tactics based on the current situation, such as taking cover when under heavy ranged fire or standing up to move more freely. 10.1.1.3. Movement Moving is considered a minor action that costs 3 action points. Players may move up to their best fleetness/quickness related Physical skill (such as Physical (Running) or Physical (Acrobatics) ) minus 5 (minimum of 1) as their movement distance. Since moving is a minor action, players with sufficient action points could potentially move multiple times during their turn, or move and still take a major action. Moving through difficult terrain costs additional movement points as determined by the terrain table above. 10.1.1.4. Line of Sight Players who use ranged weapons must have a line of sight to the opponents they wish to attack. Only walls block movement and line of sight. Trees, bushes, and other environmental features count as walls in outdoor settings for the purpose of blocking line of sight. Characters can see and attack through other characters, but must make their combat skill check at a -2 disadvantage per character they're attacking through. 10.1.1.5. Range Any ranged item designed to be used with the spatial relations rules should come with a specified range. Players only need line of sight and a successful skill check to hit something within the range of their ranged weapon. For targets beyond the weapon's range, players get a -1 penalty to their skill check for every hex beyond their range they aim. 10.1.1.6. Items When characters drop items due to crippling injuries or player choice during combat, these items are placed on the hex occupied by the character. Other characters can only pick up these dropped items if they are positioned on the same hex. This adds a tactical element to item management during combat, as players must consider not only their own positioning but also the potential value of items dropped by allies or enemies. 10.1.1.7. Flanking When attacking an enemy in melee combat, positioning can provide significant tactical advantages. If one or more of a character's allies are adjacent to an enemy that the character is attacking, this is considered flanking . Flanking provides the following benefits: The attacking character receives a +1 bonus to all attack skill checks against the flanked enemy The flanked enemy receives a -1 penalty to all of their attack skill checks Flanking represents the tactical advantage of having multiple attackers positioned around an enemy, making it difficult for the target to defend against attacks from multiple directions simultaneously. This bonus applies to all melee attacks, and the penalty applies to all attacks made by the flanked character until the flanking conditions change (either the allies move away or the target moves). 10.1.1.8. Zone of Control Each character exerts control over the area immediately surrounding them. The six hexes adjacent to any character constitute their zone of control . This represents the area that a character can effectively threaten with their presence and weapons. When an opponent enters a character's zone of control, that opponent is considered engaged with the character. If the opponent attempts to leave the zone of control without first knocking the controlling character unconscious or killing them, the controlling character may make a free attack against the fleeing opponent as they attempt to escape. This free attack: Is made immediately when the opponent attempts to leave the zone of control Does not consume the controlling character's major or minor action Must be declared before the opponent's movement is resolved Uses the controlling character's relevant combat skill Is resolved as a normal attack sequence (declare, roll, determine, damage, armor, apply) This rule represents how difficult it is to simply walk away from an armed opponent without dealing with them first. The zone of control mechanic adds tactical depth to positioning and makes retreats more strategically meaningful. The warehouse battle was a tactical puzzle. Kaelen stood adjacent to one pirate, while his ally Anya flanked the same enemy from the opposite side. This gave Kaelen a +1 bonus on his attack. He spent 6 AP to attack, landing a solid hit. With 3 AP remaining, he declared he was moving back. But as he tried to leave the hex adjacent to the pirate, the GM interjected, \"Not so fast. You're leaving his Zone of Control. Before you can move, the pirate you just stabbed takes a free swing at you as you try to disengage.\" 10.1.2. Vehicles This advanced combat rule requires the Spatial Relations rules to be in use. Vehicles add a new layer of tactical complexity to combat encounters. Whether it's a high-speed chase through a futuristic city or a naval battle between warships, vehicles require different handling than regular characters. 10.1.2.1. Vehicle Statistics Every vehicle has several key statistics: Size : Determines how many characters a vehicle can hold: Small (S): One character riding on the outside Medium (M): One character riding on the inside Large (L): Four characters riding on the inside Extra Large (XL): Six characters riding on the inside Acceleration Rate : A constant value measured in hexes, representing how many hexes the vehicle can add to its current speed each turn. This value also determines how many hexes the vehicle can subtract from its current speed each turn when braking. For example, a vehicle with an acceleration rate of 2 can increase or decrease its speed by up to 2 hexes per turn. Maneuverability : A constant rating that determines how many hex sides the vehicle can turn each turn. For example, a vehicle with a maneuverability of 2 can change its facing by up to 2 hex sides per turn. Damage Resistance (DR) : A constant value that reduces damage taken by anyone inside the vehicle. Characters riding inside a vehicle apply this DR in addition to any armor they are wearing when determining damage taken from attacks. Vehicles also have variable values that are tracked during play: Speed : A variable value that changes over time and represents the number of hexes a vehicle moves on its turn, as long as this value is greater than zero. Vehicles must move this many hexes in the direction they are currently facing. Represented using a d100. Facing : The current hex side the vehicle is pointed, which determines the direction of movement. Represented by the direction the vehicle token or mini is pointing in. 10.1.2.2. Steering and Movement Vehicles have two primary movement actions that each cost 3 Action Points: Accelerating or Braking : Vehicles can accelerate or brake by up to their acceleration rate in hexes per turn. Acceleration increases the vehicle's speed, while braking decreases it. A vehicle's speed can never be reduced below zero. Turning : Vehicles can change their facing by up to their maneuverability rating in hex sides per turn. When steering, the vehicle's facing changes first, and then the vehicle moves in that new direction. This means that players can plan their turns by first deciding how much to turn, then moving the appropriate number of hexes in that direction. Vehicles must move a number of hexes equal to their current speed on each turn, as long as their speed is greater than zero. This movement is mandatory and must be in the direction the vehicle is currently facing. Players cannot choose to move fewer hexes than their current speed. 10.1.2.3. Using Vehicles in Combat Characters operating vehicles use the vehicle's movement rules instead of their own. Any characters riding in the vehicle move with it automatically. Attacks against vehicles directly are not possible in this system. Instead, characters must target those inside the vehicle, and vehicles act as simple pieces of armor for the characters inside the vehicle, but not outside. Vehicles can be used to ram enemies. This does an amount of damage points determined by the vehicle's size plus its current speed, where Small=5, Medium=10, Large=15, XL=20. The target can make a defense roll (such as a skill check against Physical (Dodge) ) as normal, even though the vehicle does not make a combat roll or roll for damage. XL vehicles can also be used to knock down walls, but this reduces the speed of that vehicle back down to one. Jax was in a desperate chase, his armored car's speed at a blistering 15 hexes per turn. A sharp corner loomed. On his turn, he took two movement actions. First, he slammed on the brakes, using his car's Acceleration Rate of 3 to reduce his speed to 12. For his second action, he wrenched the wheel, using his Maneuverability of 2 to change his car's facing by two hex sides. The GM resolved the turn: \"You screech around the corner, successfully changing your facing. Now, you must move your new speed of 12 hexes in that new direction.\"","title":"Appendix I - Advanced Rules"},{"location":"advanced.html#10-appendix-i-advanced-rules","text":"This chapter is a compendium of extra, optional rules to add on to the various modular subsystems of OpenAxiom, for Game Masters who want even more tactical choice, mechanical variety, and simulation.","title":"10.

This value also determines how many hexes the vehicle can subtract from its current speed each turn when braking. For example, a vehicle with an acceleration rate of 2 can increase or decrease its speed by up to 2 hexes per turn. Maneuverability : A constant rating that determines how many hex sides the vehicle can turn each turn. For example, a vehicle with a maneuverability of 2 can change its facing by up to 2 hex sides per turn. Damage Resistance (DR) : A constant value that reduces damage taken by anyone inside the vehicle.

Using Vehicles in Combat"},{"location":"channeling.html","text":"7. Channeling Channeling is the universal mechanism for extraordinary abilities. This system provides a genre-less and setting-less framework for powers like psionics, magic, nanotech manipulation, reality bending, or quickhacking. The rules for Channeling are designed to be abstract and flexible. This allows Game Masters to adapt them to any setting. Like the combat system, the Channeling rules are optional. Tables that prefer a lower-fantasy or more grounded setting can choose to ignore this chapter entirely. These rules are for tables that enjoy characters with supernatural or superhuman powers. 7.1. The Channeling System The Channeling system is based on a character's skill, ability slots, and the specific abilities the character has prepared. 7.1.1. Channeling Skills Channeling is a general skill category. This skill represents a character's ability to harness and control extraordinary energies or forces. Like other skills, it has a numerical value. The default value for the general Channeling skill is 9. Specific types of Channeling are represented as specializations. For example: Channeling (Magic) for spellcasters. Channeling (Psionics) for psychics. Channeling (Nanotech) for characters manipulating microscopic robots. Channeling (Cybernetics) for characters manipulating implants and networked devices. Channeling (Reality) for reality benders. The Game Master determines which Channeling specializations are available in the game world. Players can use the general Channeling skill for a specialized task with the standard -1 penalty per level of specialization as per the rules in Character Mechanics. 7.1.2. Ability Slots A character's ability to manage and prepare Channeling abilities is determined by their highest skill value within the Channeling skill hierarchy. This skill value determines the number of ability slots a character has. Best Channeling Skill Ability Slots 9-10 1 11-12 2 13-14 3 15-16 4 17-18 5 A character can prepare a number of abilities equal to their available slots. These abilities are chosen from a list of abilities the character knows. A character can only change their prepared abilities between game sessions. This represents a period of rest, meditation, or recalibration. As a character's skill value increases through character advancement, their number of ability slots also increases, representing the greater number of abilities they can wrangle. 7.1.3. Channeling Abilities Channeling abilities are specific applications of a character's power. Each ability has a defined effect, an Action Point (AP) cost, and a Required Skill level. By default, activating an ability is a single Major Action that does not require a skill check from the user. The power simply works. However, more complex abilities may have different activation requirements, drawing on other core mechanics of the game. These can include requiring prerequisite items, or functioning as a Group Action, an Extended Action, or even a Contested Extended Action. These special conditions will be listed in the ability's definition. If an ability targets another character who is aware of the attempt, the target may be able to resist. This is resolved as a Contested Action . The Channeller does not roll; their 'roll' is considered an automatic Standard Success . The defender then rolls their relevant defense skill. The outcome is determined by the defender's degree of success: Failure (Marginal, Exceptional, or Critical): The ability takes its full effect. Standard Success: The ability takes its full effect, as the channeler wins the tie. However, the defender gains Momentum . Exceptional Success: The defender successfully overcomes the ability's effect. The power rebounds, and the channeler gains one level of Flux. Critical Success: The defender not only overcomes the ability, but turns it back on the channeler. The ability fails, and the channeler must immediately roll on the Resonance Cascade table. The corporate guard stood between the psychic Eva and the console she needed to reach. She focused her will, intending to use Psychic Push . This was a Contested Action. Eva's power was an automatic Standard Success . The guard, aware of the mental assault, braced himself and rolled against his Physical (Strength) of 12. He got a 6 \u2014 an Exceptional Success. The GM described the result: \"Your psychic force slams into the guard, but he stands firm as if rooted to the floor. The energy rebounds, jolting you with feedback. You gain one level of Flux.\" The format for defining a Channeling ability is as follows: Ability Name Required Skill Prerequisites [List of required abilities, or None] Activation [Activation method, e.g., Major Action, Extended Action (3 turns)] AP Cost [AP cost] Effect [Description of the effect] Defense [Skill used for defense, if any] Some powerful abilities may also require knowledge of other, more basic abilities as a Prerequisite . This represents a character building on their foundational knowledge to create more complex effects. An ability is considered \"learned\" once it has been successfully used four times. An ability is considered successfully used if it applies as the user intends: is not effected by anything on the resonance table, is not resisted by a target, or does not have its Extended Action failed if it requires one. An ability's prerequisite abilities must have been fully learned (used successfully four times each) before the more advanced ability can be selected and prepared in an ability slot. This learning mechanism represents the practice and mastery needed to build upon foundational abilities. 7.1.3.1. Example Abilities Here are some example abilities to illustrate the system. Psychic Push Channeling (Psionics) 10 Prerequisites None Activation Major Action AP Cost 6 Effect The character creates a telekinetic force. This force can push an object or character of human size up to 3 hexes away. This does no damage. Defense Physical (Strength) Telekinetic Barrier Channeling (Psionics) 13 Prerequisites Psychic Push Activation Major Action AP Cost 10 Effect Creates a temporary, invisible wall of force in an adjacent hex. The wall is 2 hexes wide and blocks line of sight and movement for one round. Defense None Minor Heal Channeling (Magic) 11 Prerequisites None Activation Major Action AP Cost 8 Effect The character touches a character. The target heals 1d6 HP on a single body location of the channeler's choice. This cannot be used on oneself. Defense None Flesh Knit Channeling (Nanotech) 11 Prerequisites None Activation Major Action AP Cost 8 Effect The channeler directs a swarm of nanites to repair living tissue. The target heals 1d6 HP on a single body location. This can be used on oneself. Defense None Weapon Glitch Channeling (Cybernetics) 12 Prerequisites None Activation Major Action AP Cost 8 Effect Targets a character using a weapon with a smart-link or other cybernetic integration. The weapon is rendered inoperable for the target's next turn. Defense Computers (Security) System Shock Channeling (Cybernetics) 13 Prerequisites Weapon Glitch Activation Major Action AP Cost 10 Effect The character sends a disruptive signal to a target with cybernetic implants. The target gains one level on their Mental Harm tracker. This cannot push the tracker beyond level 3. Defense Computers (Security) Reality Warp Channeling (Reality) 15 Prerequisites None Activation Extended Action (2 turns) AP Cost 12 Effect The character may alter a minor, non-living detail of the environment. For example, changing the color of a wall, creating a small object, or making a door unlock. The change must be temporary and cannot directly harm a character. Defense None 7.2. Modifying Abilities with Techniques Channelers can learn to alter their abilities on the fly, applying special techniques to change how their powers manifest. Applying a technique is a choice made just before an ability is activated. Only one technique may be applied at a time, to avoid order of operations problems. The following techniques are available: Technique Cost Effect Distant +2 AP Doubles the ability's effective range. If the ability does not have a range, this technique has no effect. Subtle +1 Flux The ability manifests with no obvious sensory effects (e.g., no flash of light, no sound). This makes its source difficult to pinpoint. Empowered +4 AP, +1 Flux Increases the numerical effects of the ability (damage, healing, number of targets, etc.) by 50%, rounded up. Swift Double AP Cost Halves the number of turns required for an ability activated by an Extended or Contested Extended Action. Non-lethal +1 AP Any damage inflicted by the ability is temporary. The target recovers fully at the end of the scene without lasting injury. This only applies to abilities that inflict Physical harm. Seeing two guards blocking her path, Eva knew a simple push wouldn't be enough. \"I'm using Psychic Push on the first guard,\" she said, \"but I'm applying the Empowered technique.\" The GM calculated the cost: 6 AP for the push, plus 4 AP for the technique, for a total of 10 AP. It also cost her 1 level of Flux. \"The effect is increased by 50%,\" the GM confirmed. \"Instead of pushing him 3 hexes, you'll send him flying 5 hexes. A much more powerful shove. Now, let's see if he can resist it.\" 7.3. Channeling and Consequences Using Channeling abilities can have consequences, both for the target and sometimes for the channeler. 7.3.1. Inflicting Harm Some Channeling abilities can inflict harm. The type of harm depends on the nature of the ability. A psychic attack might inflict Mental harm. A magical fireblast would inflict Physical harm. A public humiliation curse could inflict Social harm. The ability's description will specify the type and amount of harm. This harm is applied to the relevant Harm Tracker . 7.3.2. The Perils of Channeling Channeling powerful, unstable energies has consequences. Using abilities beyond one's level of mastery introduces risk and instability in the form of Flux. 7.3.2.1. Pushing Your Limits and Gaining Flux A character can attempt to use a Channeling ability even if their relevant skill is lower than the ability's Required Skill . This is known as \"Pushing.\" While this allows for greater flexibility and power, it comes at the cost of gaining Flux. For each point a character's skill is below the requirement, they gain one level of Flux immediately after the ability is used. For example, using an ability with a Required Skill of 13 when your character's skill is 11 will cause you to gain two levels of Flux. An automated turret whirred to life, and Eva was caught in the open. Her only hope was Telekinetic Barrier , an ability requiring a skill of 13. Her own skill was only 11. She had to Push. \"I'm pushing to create the barrier!\" she yelled. The GM explained the cost: \"You strain, pulling on energies you can't fully control. Because you're pushing 2 skill points, you gain two levels of Flux. Since this takes you to Flux Level 2 or higher, it triggers a Resonance Cascade . Roll a d6.\" She rolled a 2: Ability Backlash . \"As you try to form the wall of force,\" the GM narrated, \"the power snaps back! The telekinetic force slams into you , throwing you back 3 hexes.\" 7.3.2.2. The Flux System Flux is a tracker, similar to the Harm trackers, that represents a character's growing instability from channeling energies beyond their control. It has four levels. A character's Flux level can only increase from Pushing, and it is reduced through rest or specific actions. 7.3.2.3. Flux Levels and Effects Level 1 (Flickering): The character's control is slightly compromised. Any character defending against their abilities gains a +1 bonus to the skill they're rolling against, increasing their chances of resisting. Level 2 (Unstable): The power becomes volatile. Every time the character Pushes to gain Flux, including the instance that moved them up to this level, a Resonance Cascade occurs. Level 3 (Overloaded): The character is struggling to contain the power. They take a -2 penalty to all non-Channeling skill checks, in addition to the effects of the previous level. Level 4 (Burnout): The character is overwhelmed. They immediately take one level of Mental Harm and cannot use any Channeling abilities until their Flux is reduced below Level 4. 7.3.2.4. Resonance Cascade When a Resonance Cascade is triggered, roll a d6 on the following table to determine the outcome: Roll d6 Outcome 1 Unexpected Failure: The ability fails to manifest. The AP cost is spent and Flux is gained, but nothing happens. 2 Ability Backlash: The ability targets the channeler instead of their intended target. If the ability was self-targeted, it hits the nearest enemy instead. If that is not possible, it fails. 3 Chaotic Scramble: The intended ability fails. Instead, one of the channeler's other prepared abilities (chosen randomly) activates on the original target. 4 Energy Bleed: The raw power lashes back at the channeler. They immediately take one level of Harm on a tracker relevant to their Channeling type (e.g., Physical for Nanotech, Mental for Psionics). 5 Wild Manifestation: The ability's effect also hits a random target (friend or foe) within 5 hexes, but with half effect. If no other target is in range, the channeler takes the half effect. 6 Power Surge: The ability's numerical effects (damage, healing, range, etc.) are unexpectedly doubled. This can be beneficial or harmful depending on the situation. 7.3.2.5. Reducing Flux A character can reduce their Flux in two ways: Rest: A full night of rest reduces a character's Flux by one level. Grounding: A character can take a Major Action to ground themselves. This requires a skill check against a target number of 10, using no skill. It's the same for all characters no matter their actual skill level. A success reduces Flux by one level.","title":"Channeling"},{"location":"channeling.html#7-channeling","text":"Channeling is the universal mechanism for extraordinary abilities.

Character Creation This document is the guide for \"Session Zero.\" It contains everything a player needs to build a character from concept to completion. 2.1. Biography Every character needs a biography first. This biography consists of two freeform fields: Appearance and History. These descriptions are crucial for defining a character's identity. Players should carefully consider their character's appearance and history when selecting skills and traits. The biography helps to ensure a character's mechanical representation aligns with their narrative concept. 2.1.1. Appearance This field describes what a character looks like. It covers physical features, clothing, and any other visual characteristics. An appearance description can suggest certain skills or traits. For example, a character described as \"exceptionally tall and gaunt\" might have a high skill in Stealth or a trait representing Frail Constitution . A \"heavily muscled individual with calloused hands\" might have high Strength or a trait for Powerful Build . 2.1.2. History This field outlines a character's past experiences and background. It can include significant life events, training, or personal struggles. A character's history directly informs their skill and trait selection. For example, a \"former deep-space miner\" might have high Piloting (Mining Vessels) or a trait for Claustrophobia . A \"childhood spent studying ancient languages\" could lead to high Linguistics or a trait for Bookish . 2.2. Character Points Pool Now that your character has an appearance and backstory, it's time to choose skills and traits , which are the main mechanical features of a character in OpenAxiom. Yes, that's right: not only does OpenAxiom not have character races or classes, it entirely lacks character attributes (such as STR, DEX, INT, etc) too! OpenAxiom uses a point-based character creation system for determining a character's starting skills and traits. Each player starts with a pool of character points, which represents the default human level of capability. The Game Master may adjust this pool up or down depending on the campaign's power level, typically ranging from 3-7 points, with 5 representing the average capabilities of an average human. Character points can be spent in three ways: Increasing skills above the default value of 9 (costs 1 point per skill level above 9, unlike story points , which are used to upgrade characters after creation, and have an increasing cost curve) Purchasing positive traits (costs 1 point per trait level) Purchasing negative traits (gains 1 point per trait level) Skills, positive traits, and negative traits all cost points at a 1:1 ratio, making them equally valuable in character creation. They are chosen from lists provided by the GM for the setting, genre, and tone of the campaign. Players can spend multiple character points on a single skill to increase it by more than one level. However, players may not reduce skills below the default value of 9 to gain additional character points. This prevents players from creating dump stats to gain an excessive number of character points. Each chosen skill, positive trait, and negative trait must be justified by a one-sentence appeal to the character's Appearance and History sections. For example, a player with 5 character points could: Buy a skill at 14 (costs 5 points), using all 5 points Or buy a skill at 12 (costs 3 points) and a +2 positive trait (costs 2 points), using all 5 points Or buy a skill at 11 (costs 2 points), a +2 positive trait (costs 2 points), and a -3 negative trait (gains 3 points), leaving 4 points for a very big positive trait Or distribute points across many smaller improvements Ben wants to create a brilliant but frail academic. Starting with 5 Character Points, he decides to lean into this concept. To represent his character's physical weakness, he takes the Frail negative trait at a value of -4. This immediately gives him 4 extra CP, boosting his pool to a total of 9. He then invests heavily in his character's intellect, spending 5 CP to raise his Investigation skill from 9 to a formidable 14. With his remaining 4 CP, he purchases the Photographic Memory positive trait at +4, perfectly capturing the image of a scholar with a mind like a steel trap but a body like glass. 2.3. Skills A skill represents anything a character can do or be. This includes physical abilities like strength or swimming, and mental aptitudes such as various forms of intelligence. Skills are trainable, meaning a character's proficiency can improve over time. Skills have a name, indicating the scope and applicability of the skill, and a numerical value, indicating the character's proficiency with it. Any general skill not explicitly listed on a character's sheet has the default value of 9 (for more on this, see Character Mechanics ). Effective skill values (which are a combination of skill values, trait values, and any other bonuses or penalties in play) in OpenAxiom are theoretically infinite, but a player's actual skill value must range from 0 to 28, representing the full spectrum of capability in a 3d6 \u00b1 10 system. All skills start at the default value of 9. Players can increase skills above 9 using their character points, but cannot decrease skills below 9 to gain additional points, although skills may be reduced below 9 by negative traits. Players may choose specific skills without choosing the more general version. For example, a character can have Piloting (Starship) without having Piloting . When a character has a specific skill but not its more general version, they can only use that specific skill for tasks that match it exactly, or are sub-specialties of it (such as Piloting (Starship) (Freighter) ). They cannot use it as a substitute for other specializations of the same general skill, or for the general skill itself. The Game Master provides a list of skills that are available in their game world. Players must always use the most specific applicable skill from this list when making skill checks. For example, if a GM's list includes both Physical (Stealth) and Physical (Stealth) (Urban) , and a character is attempting to hide in an urban environment, they must use Physical (Stealth) (Urban) rather than the more general Physical (Stealth) skill. 2.4. Trait Selection During character creation, players may also use their character points pool to purchase positive and negative traits from lists provided by the Game Master. Traits represent inherent skills, talents, or aptitudes your character may have. 2.4.1. Trait Values All traits are inherently either positive (a boost) or negative (a hindrance). However, traits do not have an inherent value by default. Instead, players choose the value of each trait they want to take (known as the trait level ), and then spend or gain that many character points accordingly. For positive traits, the player chooses a value and spends that many character points from their pool. For negative traits, the player chooses a value and gains that many character points to their pool. Each chosen trait must be justified by a one-sentence appeal to the character's Appearance and History sections, just like with skills. 2.4.2. Trait Categories Traits are divided into four categories that determine how and when they apply: Broad Traits : Affect entire skill categories (like all Social skills) and represent fundamental aspects of your character. Narrow Traits : Affect specific skills (like just Art (Music) ) and represent specialized talents or limitations. Situational Traits : Only apply under specific conditions (like in darkness or extreme cold). Special Traits : Add unique game rules beyond simple bonuses, such as special abilities or rerolls. 2.4.3. Skills Versus Traits There are several important tradeoffs between skills and traits. The following table summarizes the key differences: Aspect Skills Traits Improvement Can change and improve over time Static and cannot be improved Scope Affects only the specific skill Can apply to many skills at once Maximum Value 28 Traits stack even on top of maximum-valued skills for a larger effective skill value, so the maximum value of a skill via traits is 33 Bonus Size Can give a much larger bonus in particular skills (up to +9) Capped at +5 per trait, and only the highest trait bonus applies Special Effects Simple numerical bonuses Can introduce new rules and special abilities Negative Effects None Can impose penalties or limitations, but gain you CP in return Moreover, while positive skill improvement can overcome negative traits to a certain degree, skill values cap out eventually, meaning that characters with negative traits will not only start out with a disadvantage, but also eventually fall behind those without such traits who can reach the full cap without a negative modifier. Additionally, extra points must be spent to overcome a trait, that other characters could instead spend on other things, or spend on improving the relevant skills faster. This means that negative traits create a permanent disadvantage that becomes more pronounced at the extremes of character development, and is also visible in character progression. Therefore, it is recommended to work with negative traits, not against them. For example, a character with a trait that applies a -5 penalty to Mental (Reasoning) can spend all their available character points (5 CP gained from the negative trait + the 5 starting CP) to increase that skill to 19, but it will effectively be only 14 thanks to the negative trait, whereas a character with no such disability can reach 14 just by directly spending the points. So pushing back on the trait essentially wastes character points undoing the effect of the trait. Moreover, at the high end, a character with such a negative trait could reach a skill value of 28, but the effective skill value would only be 23, whereas a character without such a negative trait could reach 28, and a character with a positive trait could reach 33. 2.4.4. Traits and Lore Items Some traits may come with associated lore items that a character must carry with them as a result of having that trait. These items are typically Small or Medium in size and don't confer mechanical advantages beyond what the trait itself provides. For example, a character with the Photographic Memory trait might carry a cybernetic implant, or a character with Night Vision might have special eye drops or wear tinted glasses. These items are considered part of the character's backstory and serve to reinforce the narrative justification for the trait. Lore items associated with traits are automatically provided to characters during character creation and do not count against their inventory slot limits. However, they can be lost or damaged during play, potentially affecting the character's ability to use their trait effectively until the item is replaced. 2.5. Item Selection During character creation, characters start with all items required by their skills, plus any worldbuilding or lore items they want, as long as those don't confer a mechanical advantage. Your best strength-related skill determines the number of inventory slots you have available to carry items. Strength-related skills include Physical (Strength) , Physical (Endurance) , and any other skills that the Game Master deems appropriate for determining carrying capacity. Items are categorized into four size classes that determine how they consume inventory slots: Small (S): These items can be fit two per inventory slot (e.g., a dagger, a book, a small tool). Medium (M): These items require one inventory slot (e.g., a sword, a backpack, a rope). Large (L): These items require two inventory slots (e.g., a suit of armor, a large weapon, a chest). Extra Large (XL): These items require multiple players to carry, with each participant using all of their open slots for the duration (e.g., a canoe, a large piece of furniture, a heavy statue). This information helps you understand how many items your character can realistically carry when selecting starting equipment. 2.6. Factions During character creation, players should consider which faction their character primarily identifies with, consulting with their Game Master to determine what factions are available in the game's setting and which would be reasonable for a player in the planned campaign to be a part of. This faction represents their background, cultural upbringing, or primary affiliation. This choice helps inform the character's background and can suggest appropriate skills and traits. For example, a character from a scholarly faction might have high Languages or Investigation skills, while one from a criminal faction might excel in Social (Deception) or Physical (Stealth) . Characters start with a reputation score of 3 with their chosen primary home faction, representing their familiarity and standing within their own community. As the character encounters members of other factions during play, their reputation with those factions will be tracked separately, starting at 0 for neutral first encounters. The Game Master should use the expanded faction relationship system where initial reputation with new factions is determined by the character's existing relationships. See the Social Relations chapter for details on this core rule. 2.7. Full Walkthrough Example: Creating Jax Sarah sits down for Session Zero, eager to create her character for the GM's new cyberpunk campaign. She has a concept in mind: a street-level courier who is fast and clever, but haunted by a past brush with faulty cybernetics. 1. Biography First, she breathes life into her character, Jax, by defining his story. Appearance: She pictures him clearly: \"Jax is a lanky man in his late twenties, with a mess of dark hair that's perpetually damp with rain or sweat. His face is sharp and angular, but his most notable features are his cybernetic eyes, which glow with a faint blue light, and the worn, synth-leather duster he always wears to hide the cheap chrome of his prosthetic left arm.\" History: She writes a backstory to anchor his skills and fears: \"Jax grew up an orphan on the neon-drenched streets of Neo-Kyoto, making a living by running data and contraband for minor league gangs. A botched delivery job cost him his arm and nearly his life. He was saved by a back-alley cyber-doc who replaced the limb with a clunky, second-hand prosthetic. The experience left him with a deep-seated fear of faulty technology and a determination to get by on his wits and reflexes, rather than trusting in implants that could fail him again.\" 2. Allocating Character Points The GM has given everyone a pool of 5 Character Points (CP). Sarah plans how to spend them to reflect Jax's history. 3. Justifying Skills & Traits Sarah selects Jax's abilities, providing a one-sentence justification for each, directly tying them to his biography. First, she decides Jax's life as a courier made him an expert at avoiding notice. She spends 3 of her 5 CP to raise his Physical (Stealth) from the default 9 to 12. Justification: \"His history as a street runner and contraband courier required him to know how to move unseen through the city's underbelly.\" Next, she spends her last 2 CP to reflect his silver tongue, increasing his Social (Deception) from 9 to 11. Justification: \"Living on the streets, Jax had to lie constantly to clients, rivals, and law enforcement to survive.\" To get more points and deepen his character, she chooses a negative trait. The Broad, Situational trait Technophobia at a -3 value feels perfect. Justification: \"His history of losing his arm to a botched job and being fitted with a cheap, unreliable prosthetic has given him a profound distrust and fear of complex tech.\" Finally, she spends those 3 points on a positive trait reflecting his cyber-eyes. She chooses the Narrow trait Keen Eyesight at a +3 value. Justification: \"His appearance notes his advanced cybernetic eyes, which would logically grant him superior vision for spotting details others might miss.\" 4. Final Touches Jax automatically starts with his worn duster and a cheap data-slate as lore items. His highest strength-related skill is Physical (default 9), granting him 9 inventory slots. For his faction, Sarah and the GM agree he belongs to the \"Street Runners,\" giving him an initial reputation of 3 with his peers. Jax is ready to hit the streets of Neo-Kyoto.","title":"Character Creation"},{"location":"character_creation.html#2-character-creation","text":"This document is the guide for \"Session Zero.\" It contains everything a player needs to build a character from concept to completion.","title":"2.

Character Mechanics This document becomes the GM's primary in-game reference for how a character functions mechanically. It answers the question, \"What can a character do and what is their current state?\" 3.1. Skills A skill represents anything a character can do or be. This includes physical abilities like strength or swimming, and mental aptitudes such as various forms of intelligence. Skills are trainable, meaning a character's proficiency can improve over time. Skills have a name, denoting the skill's scope, and a numerical value, indicating proficiency. 3.1.1. Skill Naming and Hierarchy Skills are named to reflect their scope and specialization. Skills are organized into a hierarchical tree with multiple root nodes, so general skill can have more specific versions. The naming format for specific skills uses parentheses. For example, a general skill like Piloting can have a more specific version like Piloting (Starship) . This can extend further, such as Piloting (Starship) (Freighter) . The game master determines the specific skills that exist in a game world, although players can suggest new skills, or new specializations of skills, as long as the GM agrees. When a character attempts a task requiring a specific skill the character does not possess, the character can use a more general skill from the same hierarchy. However, using a general skill for a more specific task incurs a disadvantage. A character using a general skill for a more specific skill suffers a -1 disadvantage for each level of specialization their more general skill is missing. For example, using Piloting for a Piloting (Starship) task incurs a -1 disadvantage, while using Piloting for a Piloting (Starship) (Freighter) task incurs a -2 disadvantage. Rule of thumb: count the number of parenthesized expressions to see what the disadvantage should be. Kaelen, a hotshot starship pilot, finds himself at the controls of a borrowed ground-effect vehicle. The hovercraft bucks and sputters, feeling clumsy and alien compared to the sleek interceptors he's used to. The GM says, \"Okay Kaelen, the console is unfamiliar, and this thing handles nothing like a starship. Your Piloting (Starship) skill of 14 won't help you here. You'll have to use your general Piloting skill, which defaults to 9. Since you're using a general skill for a specialized task, you'll take a -1 penalty. Your target number to get this thing moving without crashing is 8.\" GM-Provided Skill Lists : The Game Master is responsible for providing players with a specific list of skills that are available in their game world. This list serves as the canonical set of skills that can be used for skill checks. Players must always use the most specific applicable skill from this list when making skill checks. For example, if a GM's list includes both Investigation and Investigation (Forensics) , and a character is examining a crime scene, they must use Investigation (Forensics) rather than the more general Investigation skill. 3.1.2. Skill Proficiency Value Each skill has a numerical value that indicates the character's level of proficiency. A higher number signifies greater ability. The default value for any general, non-specific skill (such as Strength or Piloting ) is 9. The default value of any specific skill (such as Strength (Lifting) or Piloting (Starship) ) is considered undefined if it is not in the character sheet. For the purposes of using such undefined specific skills, these skills relay up to more general skills for their value (at a disadvantage per level up to the general skill) as described in the previous section. During character creation, players can increase skills above the default value of 9 using their character points. The following table provides a qualitative evaluation of skill levels based on the probability of success for tasks of average difficulty: Skill Range Probability Range (\u2264 Value) Qualitative Level In-Game Meaning 3-5 0.46% - 4.63% Hopeless Character has virtually no chance of success. Tasks feel impossible. 6-7 9.26% - 16.20% Very Poor Minimal capability. Success requires extraordinary luck. 8 25.93% Poor Below average capability. Frequent failures even on simple tasks. 9-10 37.50% - 50.00% Average Baseline human capability. Modest chance of success on routine tasks. 11-12 62.50% - 74.07% Good Reliable performance. Succeeds more often than fails on standard tasks. 13-14 83.80% - 90.74% Very Good Skilled practitioner. Rarely fails at standard tasks. 15-16 95.37% - 98.15% Excellent Highly specialized mastery. Failure is exceptional. 17 99.54% Masterful Virtually flawless. Represents pinnacle of human capability. 18 100.00% Legendary Automatic success. Character cannot fail under normal conditions. Note that these probabilities and qualitative levels apply to tasks of average difficulty. To map tasks of higher or lower difficulty onto this table, to figure out how a character's effective skill measures up to the task at hand , just add or subtract the difficulty modifier from their skill and only then compare it to this table. For instance, if a character has a skill of 23, but the difficulty modifier is -10, then relative to the task at hand their skill would be 13, or Very Good. 3.2. Traits A trait is a passive effect, representng inherent advantages or disadvantages a character possesses. Traits typically modify a character's skills, and traits are established during character creation. Traits cannot be trained or improved. 3.2.1. Trait Value Each non-Special trait is inherently either positive (a boost) or negative (a hindrance). During character creation, the player chooses a numerical value for the trait, which determines both the trait's effect on skills and its character point cost. For positive traits, the player chooses a positive value (e.g., from +1 to +5) and spends that many character points. For negative traits, the player chooses a negative value (e.g., from -1 to -5) and gains that many character points. The value of the trait directly determines the size of its effect in the case of broad and narrow skill-based traits. For example: A player might choose the Photographic Memory trait at +3, spending 3 character points A player might choose the Absent-Minded trait at -2, gaining 2 character points Special traits, on the other hand, come with fixed costs, as they typically introduce special rules or effects that are not easily dialed up and down linearly like regular traits are. Warning: Game Masters should be aware that extreme trait values like +5 or -5 represent a 50% swing in success rates, which can have a massive effect on characters. Players are strongly encouraged to talk to their GMs before taking any such extreme traits to ensure they fit the campaign and won't unbalance the game. 3.2.2. How Traits Apply Each trait is associated with a specific list of skills that it effects. When a trait affects a skill, its effect applies to all skills hierarchically subordinate to that skill. If multiple traits affect the same skill, only the highest bonus and the highest penalty are applied. This prevents skill values from becoming unbalanced, as bonuses would otherwise stack and quickly become excessive. Traits are categorized based on how they affect skills. Understanding these categories helps players and Game Masters determine when and how traits apply during gameplay, and these categories should be noted in any trait definition , alongside the skills the category requires the trait to effect. 3.2.2.1. Broad Traits Broad traits affect one or more top-level general skill categories. These traits have wide-ranging effects across many related skills. For example, a Natural Leader trait might affect the entire Social skill category, providing bonuses to Social (Diplomacy) , Social (Command) , Social (Intimidation) , and any other skills that fall under the Social umbrella. Broad traits represent fundamental aspects of a character's personality or physiology that affect large areas of their capabilities. They're typically more impactful than narrow traits but also more balanced in their effects. Since specific skills are more commonly directly used in skill checks, and Broad traits only effect general skills, Broad traits \u2014 as well as general skills themselves \u2014 can be thought of as the closest thing in OpenAxiom to traditional character attributes like STR and DEX, but there are mechanical differences. 3.2.2.2. Narrow Traits Narrow traits affect one or more first-level specialized skills. These traits have more focused effects on specific areas of expertise. For example, Perfect Pitch affects Art (Music) specifically, rather than all Art skills. Similarly, Keen Eyesight might affect Perception (Visual) but not other perception skills. Narrow traits represent specific talents or limitations that only apply to particular skill areas. They're more specialized than broad traits and typically have more pronounced effects within their limited scope. These are less like character attributes, and more like a character having an inbuilt talent for something or even savant status with it, and/or having been trainted in it since birth. 3.2.2.3. Special Traits Traits can also be designated as \"Special\" traits. These traits introduce simple new rules that layer on top of, but do not replace, core game mechanics. Like the way cards in some deck-building games introduce custom rules, Special traits add unique mechanical effects to a character that go beyond simple skill bonuses or penalties. For example, a Second Wind trait might allow a character to recover some health once per session, or a Lucky Charm trait might allow rerolling a failed skill check once per game session. 3.2.2.4. Situational Traits Situational traits can be broad, or narrow, or special, but only activate under specific conditions defined by the trait. For example, Night Vision is a narrow situational trait that only applies to perception skills when in low-light conditions. Cold Tolerance might be a broad situational trait that affects all physical skills but only in freezing environments. The Game Master determines when situational traits activate based on the narrative circumstances. Situational traits represent abilities or limitations that only matter in specific contexts. They add flavor and tactical depth to characters without constantly affecting gameplay. The medical bay is chaos. Emergency lights cast long, dancing shadows as Dr. Aris Thorne prepares for emergency surgery. The GM sets the scene: \"Aris, the lights are failing. Your innate Doctor's Composure (+2 to all Medicine) helps you stay calm amidst the panic. However, your Shaky Hands (-3 to Surgery) are a real problem for this delicate work. Luckily, your Night Vision augments (+1 in low-light) allow you to see just enough to operate. Let's calculate your final target number.\" Calculation: 13 (Base Skill) + 2 (Broad Trait) - 3 (Narrow Trait) + 1 (Situational Trait) = 13. 3.2.3. Standard Trait Definition Format When defining traits, use the following standardized format to ensure clarity and consistency. This format should be used for all traits, whether they are from official trait packs or custom creations. Trait Name Category Skills Affected [List of skills affected by this trait] CP Cost [constant CP cost, or CP cost range for non-Special traits] Effect [Description of the mechanical effect of this trait] Example: Natural Leader Broad Skills Affected Social Effect Provides a bonus to all social interaction skills. Special traits that modify the core rules may have multiple categories: Lucky Charm Broad, Special Skills Affected All skills Effect Once per session, the character may reroll any failed skill check. 3.2.4. Trait Evolution and Modification Traits represent a character's inherent nature and are generally stable over time. However, they are not completely immutable. Through dedicated effort and significant personal growth, characters can modify their traits over time. Negative traits can be gradually reduced through story point expenditure, as detailed in the Character Advancement section. This process represents the character's journey of personal growth and resilience as they work to overcome their flaws and hindrances through in-game experiences. Positive traits, once established, remain fixed and cannot be modified through story point expenditure. They represent core aspects of a character's identity that define who they are at their foundation. 3.2.5. Example Traits The following examples are designed to showcase the breadth of the trait system, covering physical, mental, and social applications as well as the different mechanical categories. Acrobatic Recovery Special, Situational Skills Affected Physical (Acrobatics) Effect When you would be knocked prone from a failed Physical check, you may spend 1 AP to immediately make a Physical (Acrobatics) check. On a success, you land safely on your feet in an adjacent hex. This can only be attempted once per turn. Tactical Acumen Broad Skills Affected Combat, Investigation, Perception Effect Provides a bonus to skill checks related to identifying enemy weaknesses, assessing a crime scene, or noticing environmental details that could be used to one's advantage. Information Broker Special Skills Affected Streetwise, Social (Investigation) Effect Once per session, when in a populated area, the character can make a Streetwise check as an Extended Action (3 turns). On a success, they learn a useful secret related to a person, faction, or location of their choice. Iron Grip Narrow Skills Affected Physical (Grip), Physical (Climbing) Effect Provides a bonus to any skill check made to resist being disarmed or to maintain a grip. Composure Special, Situational Skills Affected Social (Deception), Physical (Endurance) Effect When this character would gain a level on their Mental or Social Harm trackers, they can choose to take a level of Physical Harm instead. This cannot be used if the Physical Harm tracker is already at Level 3 ( Wrecked ). Otherworldly Charm Broad, Special Skills Affected Social Effect Provides a bonus to all Social checks with a specific category of non-human beings (e.g., aliens, AI - chosen at character creation). However, the character suffers a -2 penalty on all Social checks with a faction that is Hostile to that group. 3.3. Items 3.3.1. Character Inventory Characters in OpenAxiom have a simple inventory system. Your best strength-related skill determines the number of inventory slots you have available to carry items. Strength-related skills include Physical (Strength) , Physical (Endurance) , and any other skills that the Game Master deems appropriate for determining carrying capacity. Items are categorized into four size classes that determine how they consume inventory slots: Small : These items can be fit two per inventory slot (e.g., a dagger, a book, a small tool). Medium : These items require one inventory slot (e.g., a sword, a backpack, a rope). Large : These items require two inventory slots (e.g., a suit of armor, a large weapon, a chest). Extra Large : These items require multiple players to carry, with each participant using all of their open slots for the duration (e.g., a canoe, a large piece of furniture, a heavy statue). Other than these size and slot requirements, inventory is very simple. Players can organize their items however they see fit, and the Game Master should generally not concern themselves with tracking exact weights or volumes. The focus is on narrative gameplay rather than detailed inventory management. Items that are particularly large, bulky, or numerous may require special consideration from the Game Master, but in general, players should be able to carry a reasonable amount of equipment based on their character's physical capabilities. 3.3.2. How Items Affect Characters The way items affect characters falls into one of three categories, with an additional modifier for situational items: 3.3.2.1. Skill Checks in a Box The most basic types of items are \"skill checks in a box.\" These items list one or more specific (not general) skills that they grant automatic successes to. This could include beers for Social (Diplomacy) checks in casual settings, bedding for Survival (Wilderness) checks to set up camp, or binoculars for Perception (Visual) checks to spot distant objects. When a character possesses such an item and attempts a relevant skill check, they automatically succeed without rolling dice, but taking the action still uses the usual amount of action points during tactical time. Quality Binoculars Skill Check in a Box Skills Affected Perception (Visual) 3.3.2.2. Skill Prerequisite Items The next level of complexity includes skill prerequisite items. These items are specified as required by a skill to perform that skill effectively. This is usually specified in resource packs, but the ultimate decision is up to the GM. For example, a lockpick set might be required for Physical (Lockpicking) checks, or a computer might be required for Computers (Hacking) checks. Such prerequisite items are not strictly necessary, but working without them will add a \"No tools\" penalty, whereas attempting to use a Crafting skill check to jerry-rig the necessary tools, if it succeeds, will result in a \"Improvised tools\" penalty. The quality of the tools can also effect what penalties apply to the relevant skill check. For more, see the Determining Target Numbers section of the Logic of Action chapter . Professional Lockpick Set Prerequisite Required For Physical (Lockpicking) Quality High/Normal/Faulty 3.3.2.3. Special Items Finally, there are Special items; much like Special traits, Special items introduce new rules that may include modifying dice outcomes or providing or removing penalties. These items add unique mechanical effects that go beyond simple skill bonuses. Examples might include a lucky charm that allows rerolling failed checks, or a suit of armor that reduces harm tracker penalties. As with Special traits, Game Masters should be cautious about introducing custom Special items, as they can significantly affect game balance. Lucky Charm Special Skills Affected All skills Effect Once per session, the character may reroll any failed skill check. Other than these officially published Special items, Game Masters should be cautious about introducing custom Special items, as they can significantly affect game balance. 3.3.2.4. Situational Items Any item can be Situational, similar to traits, in which case their effects only apply under certain conditions defined by the item's description. For example, a raincoat would only provide its benefits in wet weather, or night vision goggles would only function in low-light conditions. The Game Master determines when situational items activate based on the narrative circumstances. A situational item can be any one of the other three types, so the specification of the type in that case is a comma separated list. The format of an item card for a situational item is the same as the format for the item card of the type it is, plus the \"situation\" row. Night Vision Goggles Situational, Skill Check in a Box Skills Affected Perception (Visual) Situation Only functions in low-light conditions. 3.3.2.5. Lore Items Lore items are usually Small in size, at max Medium, and don't convey any mechanical advantage. They simply represent items the character should have for their backstory. These are represented in-game only so that it's easier to keep track of them if they're stolen, and to avoid absurd inventories full of lore items. 3.3.2.6. Weapon and Armor Properties Weapons and armor are Special items that can have additional mechanical properties beyond their basic category. These properties can be added as rows to the item cards.The items are as follows: Required Skill : Weapons have a Required Skill property indicating the minimum skill level needed to use the weapon effectively. If a character's skill level is below this requirement, they must pay additional action points to make attacks with the weapon (see combat rules). For example, a masterwork sword might have \"Required Skill: 12\" indicating it requires a Combat (Melee) skill of at least 12 to use without penalty. Damage : Weapons also have a Damage property indicating the dice rolled to determine how much harm they inflict. For example, a sword might have \"Damage: 2d6\" indicating it rolls two six-sided dice for damage. Range : Ranged weapons may have a Range property indicating the distance at which they remain effective. For example, a bow might have \"Range: 10\" indicating it can effectively target opponents within 10 hexes. Damage Resistance : Armor may have a Damage Resistance property that reduces the amount of harm the wearer takes from attacks. For example, leather armor might have \"Damage Resistance: 2\" indicating it reduces incoming damage by 2 points. These properties should be added as rows to the item card format, as shown in the example below: Elven Composite Bow Prerequisite, Special Required For Combat (Ranged) (Bow) Required Skill 10 Damage 1d8 Range 10 Leather Armor Special Damage Resistance 2 3.4. Character Status Effects Characters in OpenAxiom face various forms of harm during their adventures. To track this, every character has three separate harm trackers that represent different aspects of a character's well-being. 3.4.1. Types of Harm Trackers 3.4.1.1. Physical Harm A character with physical harm suffers penalties to skills requiring bodily coordination, strength, or endurance. The Physical tracker tracks wounds, poison, fatigue, and bodily injury. Affected General Skills: Combat (all specializations) Physical (all specializations: Strength, Acrobatics, Stealth, etc.) Piloting (all specializations) Survival (all specializations) Any other skills requiring physical exertion or coordination 3.4.1.2. Mental Harm A character with mental harm suffers penalties to skills requiring concentration, memory, or cognitive processing. The Mental tracker tracks fear, confusion, stress, and psychic damage. Affected General Skills: Computers (all specializations) Investigation Perception Engineering (all specializations) Medicine (all specializations) Any other skills requiring focused mental effort or problem-solving 3.4.1.3. Social Harm A character with social harm suffers penalties to skills requiring interpersonal interaction, emotional control, or social awareness. The Social tracker tracks humiliation, loss of face, damaged reputation, and shaken confidence. Affected General Skills: Social (all specializations: Diplomacy, Deception, Intimidation, etc.) Languages (when used in social contexts) Art (Performance) Streetwise Any other skills requiring social interaction or emotional stability 3.4.2. Harm Tracker Levels and Penalties Each harm tracker progresses through four distinct levels, with corresponding penalties: Hindered (Level 1) : The character experiences minor difficulties that affect their performance. Applies a -1 penalty to all affected skills. Impaired (Level 2) : The character suffers noticeable setbacks that significantly impact their capabilities. Applies a -2 penalty to all affected skills. Wrecked (Level 3) : The character endures severe trauma that gravely hampers their effectiveness. Applies a -3 penalty to all affected skills. Incapacitated (Level 4) : The character is completely unable to function in that way, and cannot take actions requiring that type of effort. When a harm tracker applies a penalty to a general skill, it also applies to any more specific sub-skills under that general skill. For example, if Physical harm affects Combat , it also affects Combat (Melee) and Combat (Ranged) . 3.4.2.1. Least Harmed Principle When a skill could fall under multiple harm trackers, by default the harm tracker that is least harmed is the one the skill is treated as falling under, but the decision is ultimately up to the GM. This principle represents how characters compensate for their wounds by leaning more heavily on their other capabilities to still execute a skill. For instance, a character might use Social (Streetwise) to physically intimidate a foe or to mentally recall the layout of a gang's territory, depending on if they are more mentally or physically harmed, respectively. This mechanic reflects the adaptability of characters as they work around their limitations. Examples of skills that might fall under multiple harm trackers include: Social (Streetwise) : Can be used for physical intimidation (Physical) or recalling territorial knowledge (Mental) Physical (Acrobatics) : Might be used in social performance (Social) or to mentally calculate trajectories (Mental) Combat (Melee) : Could involve social intimidation (Social) or mental tactical planning (Mental) Art (Performance) : May require physical dexterity (Physical), mental memorization (Mental), or social engagement (Social) Survival (Tracking) : Can involve physical stamina (Physical), mental pattern recognition (Mental), or social knowledge of local customs (Social) 3.4.3. Managing Harm Harm is typically inflicted by the Game Master as a result of failed rolls, environmental hazards, or narrative consequences. There are two primary methods for recovery from harm: Rest : A character can reduce one harm tracker by one level whenever they get adequate long rest and recuperation, allowing their body, mind, or social standing to heal naturally. Skill Development : When a character spends story points to improve a skill that falls under a particular harm tracker, they can also reduce that harm tracker by one level. This represents the character's growing mastery and resilience in that area of their life. This recovery is a free benefit earned by reaffirming one's capabilities. 3.5. Character Advancement As characters face trials and adventures, they grow and change. OpenAxiom represents this evolution through Story Points. These points are earned through narrative milestones and can be spent to improve skills, overcome flaws, or even gain new innate talents. This system ensures that character growth is tied directly to the story, rewarding players for engaging with the game world and their character's journey. 3.5.1. Earning Story Points Story points are awarded by the Game Master at the conclusion of significant plot beats or story moments. These moments might include: Completing a major quest or mission Overcoming a significant challenge or adversary Making a crucial discovery that advances the narrative Resolving a personal character conflict or subplot Contributing significantly to a group's success The number of story points awarded depends on the importance and difficulty of the accomplished plot beat. A minor milestone might earn 1-2 story points, while a major achievement could earn 5 or more. The Game Master has full discretion in determining both when story points are awarded and how many to give. As a general guideline, players should expect to receive 3-6 story points per typical game session, depending on the pacing of the story and the number of significant accomplishments. This pace allows for steady character development while maintaining the value of story points as meaningful rewards. 3.5.2. Spending Story Points Story points can be saved and accumulated over multiple sessions. They do not need to be spent immediately when awarded. Players can choose when to spend their accumulated story points, allowing them to save up for more significant improvements. Players have three options for spending their story points: 3.5.2.1. Improving Existing Skills Any amount of story points can be applied to skills the character already has. Increasing a skill's value requires more story points as the skill becomes more proficient. Each improvement follows a simple step progression: the first time a skill is improved (when it's initially unlocked) costs 1 story point, the second improvement costs 2 story points, the third costs 3 story points, and so on. The formula for determining the cost to improve a skill to the next level is: next level cost = new value - 9 Here's a quick reference table for the first few skill levels: Skill Value Cost From Previous 10 1 point (already paid during character creation or skill unlocking) 11 2 points 12 3 points 13 4 points 14 5 points 15 6 points 16 7 points 17 8 points 18 9 points This is the primary method for making existing capabilities more powerful. As characters improve their skills, their tactical capabilities in combat also increase. In particular, a character's maximum action points (AP) available each turn in tactical combat is determined by their best Physical skill related to dexterity or speed. When a character improves any of these skills, their available AP increases accordingly, allowing them to take more actions during their turn. Reaching the pinnacle of human skill mastery is an extraordinary feat. A character starting with a skill at the default \"unlocked\" level of 10 would need to spend a total of 44 story points to advance that skill all the way to 18 (Legendary). This represents a significant investment of time and effort, as characters typically earn only 3-6 story points per session. It would take roughly 7-15 sessions of story point earnings to reach Legendary status in a single skill, reinforcing that true mastery requires tremendous dedication and perseverance. To reach the full limit of skill value, truly supernatural abilities, it would take 189 story points, or 32-63 sessions of skill point earnings spent on nothing else, which means that either campaigns must start out at an intentional, agreed-upon high level of character power (so that players can buy up the skills at a much cheaper cost using character points), or that more grounded starting characters have a lot of room to grow for years-long campaigns! The graph below shows how a character's success rate increases over time when spending 3 story points per session to improve a skill (with story point accumulation): 3.5.2.2. Signature Abilities Once a skill reaches 18 (ignoring any trait bonuses), players have the option to spend additional story points to continue improving that skill. However, they are strongly encouraged to instead spend all story points in their bank to acquire a \"Signature Ability\" that they negotiate with the Game Master. These Signature Abilities represent the character's unique mastery and personal style with a skill, going beyond mere numerical improvement. Specialties (New Ways to Use Skills) : A Specialty grants a character a new, specific way to use a skill, often by interacting with another game system. Maneuvers (New Ways to Use Skills) : A Maneuver grants a character a new, specific action they can perform with the skill, often by interacting with another game system. Triggers (Interacting with Resources) : A Trigger allows a character to spend a resource (like Momentum) to create a special effect related to their skill. The custom rules they allow must fall into these categories. This ensures that Signature Abilities enhance the character's capabilities in meaningful ways that go beyond simple numerical bonuses, creating unique and memorable character moments that reflect their personal mastery of their chosen skills. 3.5.2.3. Unlocking New Skills One story point can be spent to unlock a new skill. This immediately grants the skill a value of 10 (1 point above the default value of 9). Any remaining story points from that award cannot be spent on the same skill - they must be used on other options. This represents the character learning a new area of expertise. Characters can have specific skills without having the more general version. For example, a character can unlock Piloting (Starship) without having Piloting . When a character has a specific skill but not its more general version, they can only use that specific skill for tasks that match it exactly. They cannot use it as a substitute for other specializations of the same general skill. If a player wants to unlock a more specific skill for a more general skill they already have, that specific skill starts at a value of 11, because knowledge is transferrable. For example, a character with Piloting at 10 who wants to unlock Piloting (Starship) would start with a value of 11 (1 point above the default value of 10 for the unlocked skill). 3.5.2.4. Overcoming Negative Traits Traits represent a character's inherent nature and are fundamentally different from trained skills. Altering them is a rare and monumental process tied directly to the character's story. Overcoming an ingrained flaw is a long and difficult process of personal growth and resilience. This is represented by gradually eroding the trait's power. Thus, characters may improve negative traits over time by spending story points. Any negative trait can be reduced by exactly one point at a time, with the character spending story points equal to the trait's current value to decrease it by one point. For example, a character with a -5 trait must spend 5 story points to reduce it to -4. Later, they would need to spend 4 story points to reduce it to -3, and so on, until the trait eventually reaches 0 and is removed entirely. This system represents gradual character growth as players work to overcome their character's flaws and hindrances through in-game experiences. Traits can only be improved in this incremental fashion and cannot be removed entirely in a single expenditure of story points. Note that existing positive traits are fixed and cannot be modified through story point expenditure. Only negative traits can be reduced or overcome. 3.5.2.5. Gaining Positive Traits Gaining a new innate positive trait is a profound and permanent change to a character. This transformation requires extraordinary performance and calculated risk. The process has three steps: Precondition : A character may only attempt to gain a new positive trait if they have scored a critical success during a pivotal story moment. A critical success is a roll of 3 or 4 on 3d6. The game master determines what constitutes a pivotal story moment. This opportunity can only be claimed when story points are next awarded, not in the middle of a session. Attempt : To attempt the transformation, the player must declare they are making a Crucible Roll. They must then commit all story points from the current award to the attempt. This investment has two parts: The Potential: The maximum value of the new trait equals the points spent, up to a maximum of +5. The Ante: Any story points spent beyond 5 are lost. They are the price paid for the chance to change. Example: A player is awarded 8 story points. They must spend all 8 points to attempt the Crucible Roll. The maximum trait they can gain is +5. The extra 3 points are lost in the process, regardless of the outcome. Outcome : After spending the points, the player names their desired trait and makes the Crucible Roll (3d6). The outcome depends on the result. Roll Result Outcome Success (5 - 16) Success. The character's focus pays off. They gain the new positive trait at the full value of the points invested up to +5. Critical Success (3-4) Transcendence. An incredible breakthrough! They gain the new positive trait at its full value, plus an additional +1 bonus, giving them a truly superhuman trait. Critical Failure (17-18) Backlash. The attempt fails catastrophically, scarring the character. The positive trait is not gained. Instead, they gain a new, permanent negative trait with a fixed value of -3. This trait should be narratively linked to the failed attempt (e.g., trying for Deadeye might result in Nerve Jitters). 3.6. Advancement in Play: The Story of Jax After a tense session where Jax successfully infiltrated a corporate server farm, the GM awards him 4 Story Points (SP). Improving a Skill Jax's life depended on his stealth. Sarah decides to invest in what works. \"I'm spending all 4 of my Story Points to increase Jax's Physical (Stealth) ,\" she declares. The cost to go from 12 to 13 is 4 SP (13 - 9 = 4), a perfect fit. Jax is now even harder to pin down. Overcoming a Trait Months later, after many close calls involving technology, Jax has 3 SP saved up. Sarah decides it's time he started confronting his fears. \"I want to work on Jax's Technophobia ,\" she tells the GM. \"It's at -3, so I'll spend 3 story points to reduce its penalty to -2.\" Jax is still wary, but the crippling fear is beginning to subside. Gaining a Trait In the campaign's climax, Jax's nemesis is escaping. Jax has one shot.

This includes physical abilities like strength or swimming, and mental aptitudes such as various forms of intelligence. Skills are trainable, meaning a character's proficiency can improve over time. Skills have a name, denoting the skill's scope, and a numerical value, indicating proficiency.","title":"3.1. Skills"},{"location":"character_mechanics.html#311-skill-naming-and-hierarchy","text":"Skills are named to reflect their scope and specialization. Skills are organized into a hierarchical tree with multiple root nodes, so general skill can have more specific versions. The naming format for specific skills uses parentheses. For example, a general skill like Piloting can have a more specific version like Piloting (Starship) . This can extend further, such as Piloting (Starship) (Freighter) . The game master determines the specific skills that exist in a game world, although players can suggest new skills, or new specializations of skills, as long as the GM agrees. When a character attempts a task requiring a specific skill the character does not possess, the character can use a more general skill from the same hierarchy. However, using a general skill for a more specific task incurs a disadvantage. A character using a general skill for a more specific skill suffers a -1 disadvantage for each level of specialization their more general skill is missing. For example, using Piloting for a Piloting (Starship) task incurs a -1 disadvantage, while using Piloting for a Piloting (Starship) (Freighter) task incurs a -2 disadvantage. Rule of thumb: count the number of parenthesized expressions to see what the disadvantage should be. Kaelen, a hotshot starship pilot, finds himself at the controls of a borrowed ground-effect vehicle. The hovercraft bucks and sputters, feeling clumsy and alien compared to the sleek interceptors he's used to. The GM says, \"Okay Kaelen, the console is unfamiliar, and this thing handles nothing like a starship. Your Piloting (Starship) skill of 14 won't help you here. You'll have to use your general Piloting skill, which defaults to 9. Since you're using a general skill for a specialized task, you'll take a -1 penalty. Your target number to get this thing moving without crashing is 8.\" GM-Provided Skill Lists : The Game Master is responsible for providing players with a specific list of skills that are available in their game world. This list serves as the canonical set of skills that can be used for skill checks. Players must always use the most specific applicable skill from this list when making skill checks. For example, if a GM's list includes both Investigation and Investigation (Forensics) , and a character is examining a crime scene, they must use Investigation (Forensics) rather than the more general Investigation skill.","title":"3.1.1. Skill Naming and Hierarchy"},{"location":"character_mechanics.html#312-skill-proficiency-value","text":"Each skill has a numerical value that indicates the character's level of proficiency. A higher number signifies greater ability. The default value for any general, non-specific skill (such as Strength or Piloting ) is 9. The default value of any specific skill (such as Strength (Lifting) or Piloting (Starship) ) is considered undefined if it is not in the character sheet. For the purposes of using such undefined specific skills, these skills relay up to more general skills for their value (at a disadvantage per level up to the general skill) as described in the previous section. During character creation, players can increase skills above the default value of 9 using their character points. The following table provides a qualitative evaluation of skill levels based on the probability of success for tasks of average difficulty: Skill Range Probability Range (\u2264 Value) Qualitative Level In-Game Meaning 3-5 0.46% - 4.63% Hopeless Character has virtually no chance of success. Tasks feel impossible. 6-7 9.26% - 16.20% Very Poor Minimal capability. Success requires extraordinary luck. 8 25.93% Poor Below average capability. Frequent failures even on simple tasks. 9-10 37.50% - 50.00% Average Baseline human capability. Modest chance of success on routine tasks. 11-12 62.50% - 74.07% Good Reliable performance. Succeeds more often than fails on standard tasks. 13-14 83.80% - 90.74% Very Good Skilled practitioner. Rarely fails at standard tasks. 15-16 95.37% - 98.15% Excellent Highly specialized mastery. Failure is exceptional. 17 99.54% Masterful Virtually flawless. Represents pinnacle of human capability. 18 100.00% Legendary Automatic success. Character cannot fail under normal conditions. Note that these probabilities and qualitative levels apply to tasks of average difficulty. To map tasks of higher or lower difficulty onto this table, to figure out how a character's effective skill measures up to the task at hand , just add or subtract the difficulty modifier from their skill and only then compare it to this table. For instance, if a character has a skill of 23, but the difficulty modifier is -10, then relative to the task at hand their skill would be 13, or Very Good.","title":"3.1.2.

Traits"},{"location":"character_mechanics.html#321-trait-value","text":"Each non-Special trait is inherently either positive (a boost) or negative (a hindrance). During character creation, the player chooses a numerical value for the trait, which determines both the trait's effect on skills and its character point cost. For positive traits, the player chooses a positive value (e.g., from +1 to +5) and spends that many character points. For negative traits, the player chooses a negative value (e.g., from -1 to -5) and gains that many character points. The value of the trait directly determines the size of its effect in the case of broad and narrow skill-based traits. For example: A player might choose the Photographic Memory trait at +3, spending 3 character points A player might choose the Absent-Minded trait at -2, gaining 2 character points Special traits, on the other hand, come with fixed costs, as they typically introduce special rules or effects that are not easily dialed up and down linearly like regular traits are. Warning: Game Masters should be aware that extreme trait values like +5 or -5 represent a 50% swing in success rates, which can have a massive effect on characters.

Increasing a skill's value requires more story points as the skill becomes more proficient. Each improvement follows a simple step progression: the first time a skill is improved (when it's initially unlocked) costs 1 story point, the second improvement costs 2 story points, the third costs 3 story points, and so on. The formula for determining the cost to improve a skill to the next level is: next level cost = new value - 9 Here's a quick reference table for the first few skill levels: Skill Value Cost From Previous 10 1 point (already paid during character creation or skill unlocking) 11 2 points 12 3 points 13 4 points 14 5 points 15 6 points 16 7 points 17 8 points 18 9 points This is the primary method for making existing capabilities more powerful. As characters improve their skills, their tactical capabilities in combat also increase. In particular, a character's maximum action points (AP) available each turn in tactical combat is determined by their best Physical skill related to dexterity or speed. When a character improves any of these skills, their available AP increases accordingly, allowing them to take more actions during their turn. Reaching the pinnacle of human skill mastery is an extraordinary feat. A character starting with a skill at the default \"unlocked\" level of 10 would need to spend a total of 44 story points to advance that skill all the way to 18 (Legendary). This represents a significant investment of time and effort, as characters typically earn only 3-6 story points per session. It would take roughly 7-15 sessions of story point earnings to reach Legendary status in a single skill, reinforcing that true mastery requires tremendous dedication and perseverance. To reach the full limit of skill value, truly supernatural abilities, it would take 189 story points, or 32-63 sessions of skill point earnings spent on nothing else, which means that either campaigns must start out at an intentional, agreed-upon high level of character power (so that players can buy up the skills at a much cheaper cost using character points), or that more grounded starting characters have a lot of room to grow for years-long campaigns!

This is represented by gradually eroding the trait's power. Thus, characters may improve negative traits over time by spending story points. Any negative trait can be reduced by exactly one point at a time, with the character spending story points equal to the trait's current value to decrease it by one point. For example, a character with a -5 trait must spend 5 story points to reduce it to -4. Later, they would need to spend 4 story points to reduce it to -3, and so on, until the trait eventually reaches 0 and is removed entirely. This system represents gradual character growth as players work to overcome their character's flaws and hindrances through in-game experiences. Traits can only be improved in this incremental fashion and cannot be removed entirely in a single expenditure of story points. Note that existing positive traits are fixed and cannot be modified through story point expenditure. Only negative traits can be reduced or overcome.","title":"3.5.2.4. Overcoming Negative Traits"},{"location":"character_mechanics.html#3525-gaining-positive-traits","text":"Gaining a new innate positive trait is a profound and permanent change to a character. This transformation requires extraordinary performance and calculated risk. The process has three steps: Precondition : A character may only attempt to gain a new positive trait if they have scored a critical success during a pivotal story moment. A critical success is a roll of 3 or 4 on 3d6. The game master determines what constitutes a pivotal story moment. This opportunity can only be claimed when story points are next awarded, not in the middle of a session. Attempt : To attempt the transformation, the player must declare they are making a Crucible Roll. They must then commit all story points from the current award to the attempt. This investment has two parts: The Potential: The maximum value of the new trait equals the points spent, up to a maximum of +5. The Ante: Any story points spent beyond 5 are lost. They are the price paid for the chance to change. Example: A player is awarded 8 story points. They must spend all 8 points to attempt the Crucible Roll. The maximum trait they can gain is +5. The extra 3 points are lost in the process, regardless of the outcome. Outcome : After spending the points, the player names their desired trait and makes the Crucible Roll (3d6). The outcome depends on the result. Roll Result Outcome Success (5 - 16) Success. The character's focus pays off. They gain the new positive trait at the full value of the points invested up to +5. Critical Success (3-4) Transcendence. An incredible breakthrough! They gain the new positive trait at its full value, plus an additional +1 bonus, giving them a truly superhuman trait. Critical Failure (17-18) Backlash. The attempt fails catastrophically, scarring the character. The positive trait is not gained. Instead, they gain a new, permanent negative trait with a fixed value of -3. This trait should be narratively linked to the failed attempt (e.g., trying for Deadeye might result in Nerve Jitters).","title":"3.5.2.5.

Combat Combat situations arise naturally in many genres and settings. OpenAxiom recognizes that violence is sometimes necessary in fiction, and that in fact it is often a key aspect of why people enjoy TTRPGs, and so provides mechanics that make these scenes engaging and meaningful, providing enough simulationist crunch to add consistent and serious consequences and interesting tactical choices. At the same time, OpenAxiom recognizes that combat may not be the goal of some tables. As a result, the combat system is designed to be optional, not strictly necessary to character progression or development. Game Masters may choose to avoid the combat rules entirely if they wish! These are designed for tables that like combat. If your table wants to focus on narrative, it can simply focus on the core character mechanics and logic of action rules, using Contested Actions or Contested Extended Actions to simulate combat when needed. This is why the health and body locations system is specified here , and not in the character mechanics section. When characters enter combat, the game shifts to the Tactical Time round structure as defined in the core game loop . This shift to Tactical Time is mandatory during combat encounters, ensuring that all actions occur in a consistent and fair sequence. During Tactical Time, each character takes turns performing actions, with initiative determined by relevant skills and traits. This system allows for detailed resolution of combat actions while maintaining the pace and excitement of violent confrontation. 6.1. The Attack Sequence When characters enter combat, the game shifts to the Tactical Time round structure as defined in the core game loop . The full sequence of play during a round in combat is defined there, including how initiative is determined and how players take turns performing actions. This section describes only the sequence of steps required to perform the \"Attack\" Major Action under Tactical Time. Remember that attacking is just one of many possible Major Actions you can take during your turn in combat. All weapons have a required skill level that must be met or exceeded to use them effectively. The action point cost to make an attack with a weapon is the standard 6 AP for a Major Action plus the additional cost based on skill difference. This additional cost is determined by subtracting the character's skill level from the weapon's required skill level, with a minimum additional cost of 0 AP. For example, if a character has a Combat (Melee) (Sword) skill of 12 and the sword requires a skill level of 10, the attack would cost 6 AP (6 + 10 - 12 = 6 + -2, minimum 0 = 6). If the character's skill is significantly lower than the weapon's requirement, the attack costs more AP. For instance, if the character has a skill of 8 and the weapon requires 10, the attack would cost 8 AP (6 + 10 - 8 = 8). For rules on how many weapons a character can wield and how to change wielded weapons, see the Wielding Weapons section. The sequence of steps required to do the \"Attack\" Major Action under Tactical Time follows this sequence: Declare : The attacker declares their attack, specifying their target, the location they are aiming for, and the weapon or type of attack they are using. Players cannot attack with weapons that are not currently wielded. Calculate Cost : The action point cost of the attack is calculated (6 AP base + weapon's required skill - character's skill, minimum 0 additional cost). Roll : The attacker makes their Combat skill check. The defender makes a relevant defense check (e.g., Physical (Dodge) ). Determine : The outcome is determined by comparing the Degrees of Success. The attack hits if the attacker achieves a higher degree of success. Damage : On a hit, the attacker rolls their weapon's damage. Armor : The target subtracts the Damage Resistance (DR) value of the armor covering the specific location hit from the total damage. Apply : The final damage is subtracted from the HP of the location that was hit. It was Kaelen's turn. He lunged at the pirate in front of him, combat knife a silver blur. Declare: \"I'm attacking the pirate with my knife, aiming for his Torso!\" Calculate Cost: His skill of 13 easily met the knife's requirement of 9, so the attack cost the standard 6 AP. Roll: Kaelen rolled a 7 against his target of 13\u2014an Exceptional Success. The pirate rolled a 9 against his Dodge of 10\u2014a Standard Success. Determine: Kaelen's higher degree of success meant a clean hit. Damage: His knife deals 1d6 damage; he rolled a 5. Armor: The pirate's armored clothing had a DR of 2, reducing the damage to 3. Apply: The GM narrated, \"Your blade slips past his guard, and he grunts as it sinks into his side, dealing 3 points of damage to his Torso.\" 6.2. Wielding Weapons Characters may only wield a number of weapons equal to their number of non-crippled arms. For most characters, this means they can wield up to two weapons (one in each hand). If a character has a crippled arm, they can only wield one weapon. If both arms are crippled, they cannot wield any weapons. Weapons must be claimed to be wielded prior to the beginning of tactical time. Changing which weapons are being wielded requires a Major Action during tactical time. A character cannot attack with a weapon that is not currently wielded. Each attack with a weapon costs a Major Action, as described in the Attack Sequence section. Attacks cannot be made without the weapon relevant to the skill being used to attack, if there is one, unlike most skill prerequisite items: you can't attack with a bow if you don't have a bow. 6.3. Beyond Attacks: Other Combat Actions While the attack sequence focuses on making attacks, combat encounters often involve much more than just hitting opponents. Players can use their Major Actions during combat to perform a wide variety of activities that make sense in the situation. Examples of other combat actions include: Shoving an opponent to push them backward or knock them prone Hiding behind cover or ducking behind an obstacle Attempting to disarm an opponent's weapon Climbing onto a ledge or structure for tactical advantage Binding a wound during a lull in the fighting Shouting commands to allies or intimidating enemies Searching a fallen opponent for items Activating a special ability or item When a player wants to perform an action that isn't covered by the standard attack sequence, they simply describe what they want to do and ask the Game Master. The Game Master will determine what type of skill check is appropriate based on the situation: Simple Action: For straightforward tasks that don't require opposition Contested Action: For actions that directly oppose another character's efforts Extended Action: For tasks that require time and sustained effort Contested Extended Action: For ongoing struggles between characters This approach provides much less to remember than traditional move lists while maintaining the simulational crunch players enjoy. It also allows for greater creativity and flexibility in combat situations, as players aren't limited to a predefined set of actions. 6.4. The Injury System The injury system determines what actually happens when a character takes damage. It represents different body parts separately, with different mechanical effects as a result of attacking them, to provide more interesting mechanical choices. 6.4.1. Health & Body Locations Characters have six body locations, each with its own pool of Hit Points (HP). HP is calculated from the character's Physical (Strength) , Physical (Endurance) , Constitution , or other skill values, whichever is highest. The difficulty modifier applies to the attacker's combat skill value when targeting that specific location. Body Location Hit Points Calculation Example (Strength 9) Difficulty Modifier Torso Full Physical (Strength) value 9 HP +0 Head 1/2 Physical (Strength) (round up) 5 HP -3 Each Arm 2/3 Physical (Strength) (round up) 6 HP -2 Each Leg 2/3 Physical (Strength) (round up) 6 HP -2 The following table provides a quick reference for the HP values of each body location for characters with Physical (Strength) skills ranging from 9 to 18. This is purely for convenience; the actual rule is still the calculation in the body part table above. Physical (Strength) Torso Head Each Arm Each Leg Total HP 9 9 5 6 6 38 10 10 5 7 7 43 11 11 6 8 8 49 12 12 6 8 8 50 13 13 7 9 9 56 14 14 7 10 10 61 15 15 8 10 10 63 16 16 8 11 11 68 17 17 9 12 12 74 18 18 9 12 12 75 The following graph visualizes how a character's total HP and HP per body part increase as their Physical (Strength) skill improves: 6.4.2. Consequences of Injury Damage to local HP pools does not immediately do anything. However, over time, as injuries to various parts of the body add up, global effects begin to take place. 6.4.2.1. Crippling Injury When a location's HP is reduced to 0 or below , it is Crippled. This has the following effects: Body Location Effect on Character General When a location is first Crippled, the character's Physical Harm Tracker immediately increases by one level. Head In addition to the Physical Harm, the character's Mental Harm Tracker also increases by one level. The character must make an immediate Physical (Endurance) check or fall unconscious. Arm (First Crippled) The character loses access to half of their total inventory slots, rounded up. The player must immediately choose which items to drop. Arm (Second Crippled) The character's available inventory slots are reduced to 0 Leg (First Crippled) The character's movement speed is halved. Leg (Second Crippled) The character's movement speed is reduced to a minimum of 1. A limb may go into the negative HP levels as well. This does not make the crippling worse, but it can have other consequences, as described in the Systemic Shock section. 6.4.2.2. Critical Success on Attack When an attacker scores a Critical Success, they deal damage as normal. In addition, the target's Physical Harm Tracker immediately increases by one level. This is independent of and can stack with Harm gained from a Crippling Injury on the same attack. 6.4.2.3. Systemic Shock Systemic shock occurs whenever a character's total HP pool is decreased by another half of their total original HP pool. The character's Physical Harm Tracker increases by one level for every half of their total original HP pool that they lose. For example, a character with average Physical (Strength) of 9 would have a total of 38 HP across all locations (9 Torso + 5 Head + 6 Left Arm + 6 Right Arm + 6 Left Leg + 6 Right Leg). This character would experience systemic shock and gain one level on their Physical Harm Tracker for every 19 HP they lose from their original total: At 38-20 HP remaining (0-18 HP lost): No systemic shock At 19-1 HP remaining (19-37 HP lost): First systemic shock (+1 to Physical Harm Tracker) At 0 HP remaining (38+ HP lost): Second systemic shock (+2 to Physical Harm Tracker) 6.4.2.4. Defeat and Death A character is taken out of a fight under the following conditions: Incapacitated : Their Physical Harm Tracker reaches Level 4. Unconscious : Their Head or Torso is Crippled, and they fail the subsequent Physical (Endurance) check. Killed : Their Head or Torso HP is reduced to a negative value equal to its starting maximum (e.g., -5 HP for a 5 HP Head). In the former two cases, staying alive becomes an Extended Action against their Physical (Strength) skill that lasts as many turns as the tactical combat scene, instead of a set number of turns. While/if they succeed, they get to continue being only unconscious until the combat scene ends. If they fail, they die. The pirate, with a Strength of 10, had only 3 HP left on his Torso. Kaelen's 3-damage strike was devastating. \"That hit reduces his Torso HP to 0,\" the GM announced. \"That location is now Crippled . His Physical Harm Tracker increases to Level 1, giving him a -1 penalty to all physical actions. He also needs to make an Endurance check to stay conscious.\" The pirate passed the check, grimacing in pain but remaining on his feet. The pirate had lost 18 HP total in the fight, just shy of the 21.5 needed to trigger Systemic Shock. For now, he was merely wounded, not yet in shock. 6.4.2.5. Non-Harm-Tracker Status Effects While the harm tracker system covers generalized status effects that affect broad categories of skills, some specific status effects operate outside this system. These non-harm-tracker-based status effects are simpler and more focused in their mechanical impact. There are three primary types: Continuous HP Drain : Effects like bleeding or poison that continuously drain HP from a specific body location. Unlike harm trackers which apply penalties to skill checks, these effects directly reduce the HP pool of the affected limb. For example, a bleeding arm would lose a set amount of HP each round until the bleeding is stopped. Note that all normal effects of HP loss still apply to continuous HP drain, including systemic shock when total HP loss reaches certain thresholds and checks for whether the limb becomes crippled when its HP reaches 0 or below. Movement Speed Detriment : Effects that reduce a character's movement speed, such as being entangled or slowed. These effects set a specific detriment to the character's normal movement allowance, reducing how many hexes they can move on their turn. Weapon Range Detriment : Effects that reduce the effective range of a character's weapons, such as poor visibility or unstable footing. These effects set a specific detriment to the weapon's normal range, reducing the distance at which the weapon remains effective. These status effects represent specific, concrete mechanical impacts rather than the generalized skill penalties of harm trackers, providing more precise simulation of certain conditions that affect characters in combat.","title":"Combat"},{"location":"combat.html#6-combat","text":"Combat situations arise naturally in many genres and settings.

Here they are, in order of granularity: Turn : a unit of time comprising a participant spending their action points on various actions before other participants get to act. Round : a unit of time comprising one iteration through each player (and NPC and enemy) getting their turn. Scene : a continuous period of gameplay that uses a single type of time. A new scene begins whenever the Game Master switches between tactical time and scene time. For example, an entire combat encounter run using tactical time is one scene. The period of free-flowing roleplaying that happens in scene time right after that combat is another scene. Session : a session of play for the day/week/month. Campaign : a full narrative with a beginning, middle, and end, composed of sessions. 4.2. Tactical Time Tactical time is used during combat encounters, chases, or any situation where precise timing and turn order are important. During tactical time, all participants (players, NPCs, and enemies) take turns in a specific order determined by initiative rolls. 4.2.1. Initiative At the start of tactical time, all participants roll 3d6. Turns are taken in order from lowest to highest roll. In the case of ties, participants with the same roll go in clockwise order from the Game Master. Each full cycle through all participants constitutes one round of tactical time. Participants retain their initiative order throughout the encounter unless specific game effects modify it. 4.2.2. Action Points In tactical time, each participant has a pool of action points (AP) they can spend on various actions during their turn. Characters start each turn with action points equal to their best Physical skill related to dexterity or speed (default value of 9). As characters improve their skills through story point expenditure, their action point pool increases accordingly, allowing for more tactical options during combat. Participants can spend their action points on any combination of actions that they can afford. Actions have varying costs: Minor Actions (3 AP) Moving up to their normal movement speed Speaking a few words or short phrases Interacting with a mundane object (opening a door, picking up an item) Taking cover or changing position Dropping an item or drawing a readily accessible item Major Actions (6 AP base cost) Attacking an opponent with a weapon (base cost 6 AP + variable cost based on weapon skill requirements) Using a skill that requires a check Activating a special ability Casting a spell or using advanced technology Performing a complex task Participants can spend any or all of their action points during their turn. Unused Action Points are typically lost at the end of your turn. However, you may declare at the start of your turn that you are reserving a specific number of AP for a Trigger. This reserved AP is not lost at the end of your turn but is instead lost before your next turn (so after an entire round has passed) if the Trigger is not activated before then. For example, a character with 9 action points could: Take one major action (6 AP) and one minor action (3 AP) for a total of 9 AP Take three minor actions (3 AP each) for a total of 9 AP Take one major action (6 AP) and have 3 AP remaining that would be lost Players who wish to set triggers (see Triggers section) must deliberately take fewer actions during their turn to maintain a reserve of unused AP that can be used for triggered actions. 4.2.3. Triggers Players can specify triggers for their actions. A trigger is an if-else condition where if the condition is met, the player's character takes an action before anyone else can act. The \"if\" part of a trigger condition must be a specific skill check, attack, movement, or posture change by another participant. This ensures triggers are tied to concrete, observable game mechanics rather than subjective interpretations. Valid trigger conditions include: When a specific enemy makes a particular skill check (e.g., \"If the guard makes a Perception (Visual) check\") When a specific enemy makes an attack (e.g., \"If the orc attacks me\") When a specific enemy moves (e.g., \"If the thief moves within 5 meters of the chest\") When a specific enemy changes posture (e.g., \"If the knight stands up from prone\") When setting a trigger, players must reserve a pool of unused action points (AP) from their previous turn. This reserved pool is used to execute the triggered action when the trigger condition is met. Players must deliberately take fewer actions during their turn to maintain this reserve, effectively \"banking\" AP for potential triggers. Trigger mechanics: Players must declare triggers and the AP pool reserved for them at the start of their turn The reserved AP pool must be sufficient to cover the cost of the triggered action If a trigger activates but there aren't enough reserved AP to cover its cost, the trigger fails Reserved AP that isn't used by triggered actions is lost at the end of the round Players can adjust their reserved AP pools and triggers at the start of each turn When multiple trigger actions are activated simultaneously: They resolve in the order they were specified to the Game Master Each triggered action consumes the appropriate action points from the character's reserved pool 4.3. Scene Time Scene time is used for exploration, roleplaying, investigation, and other non-combat situations. During scene time, gameplay is completely free-flowing: Players act when they want to act There is no turn order or initiative Players can take as many actions as appropriate to the narrative The Game Master manages the flow of events and time naturally Scene time is ideal for conversations, exploration, research, and other activities where the structured pace of tactical time would be unnecessarily restrictive. 4.4. Rests Rests represent periods when characters take time to recover from exertion, heal injuries, and restore their mental and physical well-being. The Game Master decides when rests occur based on the narrative flow and the characters' needs. Rests can only happen during scene time. This means that characters cannot rest during active combat encounters or other situations requiring tactical time. The Game Master may call for a rest when: Characters have had a particularly challenging encounter or series of encounters The narrative naturally provides a safe space for recovery Characters express a need to recuperate from injuries or exhaustion A significant amount of time has passed in the game world During a rest, characters may recover from harm through natural recovery methods. A character can reduce one harm tracker by one level whenever they get adequate long rest and recuperation, allowing their body, mind, or social standing to heal naturally. The Game Master determines the specific benefits of a rest based on its duration and conditions. A brief respite might provide minor benefits, while an extended period of rest in comfortable conditions could provide more substantial recovery.","title":"Core Game Loop"},{"location":"core_game_loop.html#4-core-game-loop","text":"OpenAxiom uses two distinct types of game time to create a dynamic and flexible gameplay experience: tactical time and scene time.

Dice Roller Tool"},{"location":"game_mastering.html","text":"9. Game Mastering This chapter serves a dual purpose: it provides guidance for human Game Masters running OpenAxiom games, and it offers an oracle system for players who wish to play solo. 9.1. The Role of the Game Master The Game Master (GM) in OpenAxiom has a fairly typical role. The GM's primary responsibilities include: Describing the World : The GM presents the game world to the players, describing environments, non-player characters (NPCs), and events in a way that engages the players' imaginations. Adjudicating Rules : When questions arise about how rules apply to specific situations, the GM makes final decisions. These decisions should be consistent with the game's logic and the established fiction. Controlling NPCs : The GM plays all non-player characters, controlling their actions, motivations, and (in concert with the social rules) responses to player actions. Managing Pacing : The GM determines when to shift between tactical time and scene time, when to allow rests, and when to award story points, controlling the flow of the game to maintain engagement and dramatic tension. Creating Challenges : The GM designs encounters, obstacles, and situations that challenge the players while remaining fair and interesting. Ensuring Fun : Most importantly, the GM works to ensure that everyone at the table, including themselves, is having an enjoyable experience. 9.2. Using the Oracle System For solo play or as an aid to a human GM, OpenAxiom includes an oracle system that can make decisions in place of a human GM. This system uses a combination of random tables and procedural generation to create dynamic, unpredictable responses to player actions. The oracle system is designed to preserve the core experience of playing OpenAxiom by maintaining the same logical consistency that a skilled human GM would provide, while introducing the element of surprise that makes the game exciting. 9.2.1. Oracle Basics When using the oracle system, players will often need to roll on various tables to determine outcomes. These rolls should be made honestly, without rerolling or selecting preferred results. The oracle works best when it can surprise you. The oracle system uses 3d6 for most rolls, just like the core game mechanics. This maintains consistency with the rest of the system and ensures that outcomes have the same probability distribution. 9.2.2. When to Consult the Oracle Players should consult the oracle in the following situations: World Details : When you need information about the environment, NPCs, or background elements that haven't been established yet. NPC Reactions : When an NPC's response to player actions isn't obvious or predetermined. Random Events : When you want to introduce unexpected complications or opportunities. Plot Development : When you're unsure how to advance the story or what challenges to present next. Skill Check Consequences : When determining the specific results of a successful or failed skill check. In some cases, such as with NPC reactions and skill checks in general, OpenAxiom already provides some specific mechanical consequences and decisions. What the Oracle is here to do is to work with those systems, to help you add more imaginative flair. 9.2.3. Oracle Tables The following tables can be used with the oracle system to generate responses to common questions. For a generalized oracle that can answer any yes/no question, see the Core Oracle Table section. 9.2.3.1. Core Oracle Table When you need to answer a yes/no question about the game world, you can use this core oracle table. This is especially useful for solo play or when you want to introduce uncertainty into your game. To use this table: Determine the likelihood that what you're asking is true using these qualitative levels: Critically Unlikely Exceptionally Unlikely Standard Unlikely Standard Likely Exceptionally Likely Critically Likely Roll 3d6 and consult the table below, cross-referencing your likelihood assessment: 3d6 Roll Critically Unlikely Exceptionally Unlikely Standard Unlikely Standard Likely Exceptionally Likely Critically Likely 3 No, but\u2026 Yes, but\u2026 Yes Yes, and\u2026 Yes, and\u2026 Yes, and\u2026 4 No, but\u2026 Yes, but\u2026 Yes Yes, and\u2026 Yes, and\u2026 Yes, and\u2026 5 No No, but\u2026 Yes, but\u2026 Yes Yes, and\u2026 Yes, and\u2026 6 No No, but\u2026 Yes, but\u2026 Yes Yes, and\u2026 Yes, and\u2026 7 No No No, but\u2026 Yes Yes Yes, and\u2026 8 No No No, but\u2026 Yes Yes Yes, and\u2026 9 No No No, but\u2026 Yes Yes Yes 10 No No No Yes Yes Yes 11 No No No Yes Yes Yes 12 No No No Yes, but\u2026 Yes Yes 13 No, and\u2026 No No Yes, but\u2026 Yes Yes 14 No, and\u2026 No No Yes, but\u2026 Yes Yes 15 No, and\u2026 No, and\u2026 No No, but\u2026 Yes, but\u2026 Yes 16 No, and\u2026 No, and\u2026 No No, but\u2026 Yes, but\u2026 Yes 17 No, and\u2026 No, and\u2026 No, and\u2026 No No, but\u2026 Yes, but\u2026 18 No, and\u2026 No, and\u2026 No, and\u2026 No No, but\u2026 Yes, but\u2026 9.2.3.1.1. Using the Core Oracle Table The results are interpreted as follows: Yes : The answer to your question is yes. No : The answer to your question is no. Yes, but\u2026 : The answer is yes, but with a complicating factor. No, but\u2026 : The answer is no, but with a silver lining. Yes, and\u2026 : The answer is yes, and something additional beneficial happens. No, and\u2026 : The answer is no, and something additional detrimental happens. 9.2.3.2. NPC Reactions When you need to determine how an NPC reacts to the players after they've rolled a social skill check against that NPC, consult this 2D table that cross-references the result of the social skill check with a second 3d6 roll: 3d6 Roll Critical Success Exceptional Success Standard Success Marginal Failure Exceptional Failure Critical Failure 3 Enthusiastic Enthusiastic Enthusiastic Enthusiastic Helpful Cold 4-5 Enthusiastic Enthusiastic Helpful Helpful Helpful Unfriendly 6-8 Enthusiastic Helpful Helpful Helpful Neutral Unfriendly 9-12 Helpful Helpful Neutral Cool Cool Unfriendly 13-15 Helpful Cool Cool Cold Unfriendly Unfriendly 16-17 Cool Cool Cold Unfriendly Hostile Hostile 18 Neutral Cold Unfriendly Hostile Hostile Hostile The degree of success is determined by consulting the Degrees of Success and Failure table in the Logic of Action chapter: Degree of Success/Failure Roll Result Critical Success 3 or 4 Exceptional Success 5 or more below target number Standard Success Equal to target or 1-4 below target Marginal Failure 1-4 above target number Exceptional Failure 5 or more above target number Critical Failure 17 or 18 NPC Reaction Descriptions: Hostile : The NPC is actively opposed to the players and may attack or sabotage their efforts Unfriendly : The NPC is suspicious, uncooperative, or actively working against the players' interests Cold : The NPC is distant and unhelpful, barely tolerating the players' presence Neutral : The NPC is indifferent to the players, neither helping nor hindering them Cool : The NPC is somewhat helpful but reserved, offering minimal assistance Helpful : The NPC is actively supportive of the players' goals and may provide significant aid Enthusiastic : The NPC is extremely helpful and may become a valuable ally or follower 9.2.3.3. Random Events When you want to introduce a random event, follow this three-step process: Determine the Event Type : Roll 3d6 and consult the Event Types table below. Determine the Circumstance Type : Roll 3d6 and consult the Circumstance Types table below. Determine the Affected Party : Roll 3d6 and consult the Affected Parties table below. Combine the results to create a specific event. For example, if you roll \"Crisis\" for event type, \"Social\" for circumstance type, and \"Player Characters\" for affected party, you might have a crisis involving a key relationship or alliance that affects the player characters. If the affected party is a faction, consider how the event affects that faction's relationships, resources, or position. 9.2.3.3.1. Event Types Roll Event Type Description 3 Crisis A sudden emergency that requires immediate attention 4-5 Obstacle A new challenge or barrier that complicates the players' plans 6-8 Discovery The players find something useful, interesting, or valuable 9-12 Opportunity A chance to advance goals or gain an advantage 13-15 Encounter Meeting with an NPC or creature that may be friend or foe 16-18 Boon A significant benefit or advantage that improves the situation 9.2.3.3.2. Circumstance Types Roll Circumstance Type Description 3-6 Physical Events affecting the material world, bodies, or physical objects 7-12 Social Events affecting relationships, alliances, or social structures 13-18 Mental Events affecting thoughts, emotions, or psychological state 9.2.3.3.3. Affected Parties Roll Affected Party Description 3-5 Player Factions Factions that the player characters belong to or are highly regarded by 6-8 Friendly NPC Factions Factions of the friendly NPCs that are affected by the event 9-12 Player Characters The player characters themselves are directly affected by the event 13-15 Friendly NPCs Friendly NPCs are directly affected by the event 16-18 Neutral NPCs Neutral or unaligned NPCs are directly affected by the event 9.2.3.4. Plot Development When determining how to advance the story, follow this three-step process: Determine the Development Type : Roll 3d6 and consult the Development Types table below. Determine the Circumstance Type : Roll 3d6 and consult the Circumstance Types table (from the Random Events section above). Determine the Affected Party : Roll 3d6 and consult the Affected Parties table (from the Random Events section above). Combine the results to create a specific plot development. For example, if you roll \"Revelation\" for development type, \"Social\" for circumstance type, and \"Player Characters\" for affected party, you might have a revelation about a key relationship or alliance that directly affects the player characters. 9.2.3.4.1. Development Types Roll Development Description 3 Setback A major complication that significantly hinders progress 4-5 Complication A new factor that makes the situation more complex 6-8 Progress The players make meaningful advancement toward their goals 9-12 Revelation Important information is discovered that changes understanding 13-15 Twist An unexpected turn of events that changes the direction of the story 16-18 Breakthrough A major success that significantly advances the players' position 9.3. Creating Encounters Whether you're a human GM or using the oracle system, creating engaging encounters is crucial to a successful OpenAxiom game. Encounters should challenge the players without being impossible, and should offer meaningful choices in how to approach them. 9.3.1. Encounter Design Principles When designing encounters, keep these principles in mind: Multiple Solutions : Good encounters can be resolved in several different ways, allowing players to use their unique skills and creativity. Meaningful Consequences : Player choices should have real impact on the outcome and future events. Appropriate Challenge : Encounters should be challenging but not overwhelming for the player characters' capabilities. Narrative Integration : Encounters should feel like a natural part of the story and world, not artificially inserted obstacles. 9.3.2. Using the Oracle for Encounter Creation The oracle system can help generate encounter elements when you're not sure what to include: 9.3.2.1. Encounter Type Roll 3d6 to determine the primary type of encounter: Roll Type Description 3-5 Combat A physical confrontation with enemies or dangerous creatures 6-8 Social An interaction with NPCs that requires negotiation, deception, or persuasion 9-12 Exploration Investigating a location, solving puzzles, or navigating hazards 13-15 Mystery Gathering information, solving crimes, or uncovering secrets 16-18 Chase A pursuit or evasion scenario requiring quick thinking and movement 9.3.2.2. Enemy Strength When determining how powerful enemies should be, roll 3d6: Roll Strength Description 3-5 Weak Enemies are significantly below the players' capabilities 6-8 Matched Enemies are roughly equal to the players' capabilities 9-12 Strong Enemies are somewhat more powerful than the players 13-15 Formidable Enemies are significantly more powerful than the players 16-18 Overwhelming Enemies are far beyond what the players can handle 9.4. Creating NPCs Creating compelling NPCs is essential for both human GMs and players using the oracle system. NPCs should feel like real people with their own motivations, goals, and personalities. 9.4.1. NPC Templates When creating NPCs, you can use these templates as starting points: Role : What function does this NPC serve in the world? Motivation : What drives this NPC to act? Personality Trait : What defining characteristic shapes this NPC's behavior? Power and Influence : How much sway does this NPC have in their environment? 9.4.1.1. Role Roll 3d6 to determine an NPC's primary role: Roll Role Description 3 Criminal An outlaw, thief, or other lawbreaker 4-5 Merchant A trader, shopkeeper, or businessperson 6-8 Official A government representative, bureaucrat, or authority figure 9-12 Expert A skilled professional or knowledgeable individual 13-15 Laborer A worker, craftsman, or service provider 16-18 Leader A person of influence, authority, or command 9.4.1.2. Motivation Roll 3d6 to determine what primarily drives an NPC: Roll Motivation Description 3 Revenge Seeking payback for a real or perceived wrong 4-5 Power Desiring control, influence, or authority 6-8 Security Wanting safety, stability, or protection 9-12 Recognition Seeking respect, fame, or validation 13-15 Wealth Pursuing money, resources, or material gain 16-18 Ideals Following a moral code, belief system, or cause 9.4.1.3. Personality Trait Roll 3d6 to determine a key personality trait: Roll Trait Description 3 Paranoid Suspicious and distrustful of others 4-5 Greedy Always looking for personal gain 6-8 Loyal Faithful to friends, family, or organizations 9-12 Honest Direct and truthful in dealings with others 13-15 Compassionate Showing empathy and concern for others 16-18 Ruthless Willing to do whatever it takes to achieve goals 9.4.1.4. Power and Influence Roll 3d6 to determine an NPC's power and influence level: Roll Level Description 3 Powerless Has no real influence or authority 4-5 Marginal Has very limited influence in a small circle 6-8 Minor Has some influence in a local area or small organization 9-12 Moderate Has notable influence in a region or medium-sized organization 13-15 Significant Has substantial influence in a large area or major organization 16-18 Pervasive Has overwhelming influence across vast areas or multiple organizations When creating NPCs, consider how their power and influence level affects their ability to affect the story, resources they can access, and how other NPCs and factions respond to them. A powerful NPC might be able to call upon significant resources or have far-reaching effects on the campaign, while a powerless NPC might be easily dismissed or ignored by other characters.","title":"Game Mastering"},{"location":"game_mastering.html#9-game-mastering","text":"This chapter serves a dual purpose: it provides guidance for human Game Masters running OpenAxiom games, and it offers an oracle system for players who wish to play solo.","title":"9.

The GM's primary responsibilities include: Describing the World : The GM presents the game world to the players, describing environments, non-player characters (NPCs), and events in a way that engages the players' imaginations. Adjudicating Rules : When questions arise about how rules apply to specific situations, the GM makes final decisions. These decisions should be consistent with the game's logic and the established fiction. Controlling NPCs : The GM plays all non-player characters, controlling their actions, motivations, and (in concert with the social rules) responses to player actions. Managing Pacing : The GM determines when to shift between tactical time and scene time, when to allow rests, and when to award story points, controlling the flow of the game to maintain engagement and dramatic tension. Creating Challenges : The GM designs encounters, obstacles, and situations that challenge the players while remaining fair and interesting.

Power and Influence"},{"location":"logic_of_action.html","text":"5. Logic of Action This section describes the decision resolution mechanism for actions in OpenAxiom. When a character attempts an action with a meaningful chance of failure, the player and Game Master use the logic of action to determine the outcome. This system provides a consistent framework for resolving uncertainty while maintaining narrative flow. The following sections detail how actions are resolved in various circumstances: 5.1. Actions The fundamental mechanic in OpenAxiom is rolling 3d6 and comparing the result to a target number. The player rolls 3d6 and sums the results. If the total is less than or equal to the target number, the action succeeds. If the total is greater than the target number, the action fails. The target number is almost always determined by the character's relevant skill values, modified by the difficulty of the check. This is the inverse of a game system like D&D, where the target number is fixed, and then the roll is modified by your skill level. This simple mechanic underlies all character actions in the game. The target number is determined by the character's relevant skill value, modified by applicable traits and situational factors as determined by the Game Master. Characters may also receive temporary modifiers from systems like Momentum , which can provide a +1 bonus to the character's skill value for the purpose of determining the target number for any action in the same scene. 5.1.1. Restriction on Repeating Skill Checks Players cannot make the same skill check twice in a row without at least 3 turns between them or a change in circumstance (as determined by the Game Master). This prevents characters from simply retrying the same action indefinitely until they succeed, encouraging creative problem-solving and narrative progression. 5.1.2. Skill Selection The Game Master provides a specific list of skills that are available in their game world. When determining which skill to use for a skill check, players must always use the most specific applicable skill from the GM's provided list. For example, if a GM's list includes both Piloting and Piloting (Starship) , and a character is attempting to pilot a starship, they must use Piloting (Starship) rather than the more general Piloting skill, even if they have a higher value in the general skill. 5.1.3. Determining Target Numbers The target number for any skill check is determined by three factors: Skill value : The base value of the most specific relevant skill on the part of the player making the check. This represents the character's competency in performing the desired action, and as such is the core mechanic of the logic of action. Trait modifiers : Any modifiers applied by the player's traits to the skill value. Adding these forms the effective skill value . This represents the inherent abilities or disabilities the character might have that effect their ability to carry out whatever action they're attempting. These are almost just as important as the character's skill value in the relevant action. Difficulty modifiers : These represent the inherent difficulty of the task, but also situational, environmental factors, such as whether it's raining while a player is trying to run. These values typically range from -10 to +10, representing extremely easy at +10, to average difficulty at 0, to extremely difficult at -10. Here's a table that can provide a general guideline for eyeballing the difficulty of different degrees of difficulty modifiers: Difficulty Modifier Task Description Examples +10 Trivial/Easy Walking on a flat, stable surface; recalling common knowledge; lifting a feather +5 to +9 Very Easy Walking carefully on a stable surface; recalling recently learned information; lifting a light object +1 to +4 Easy Simple conversation; basic arithmetic; lifting a moderately heavy object 0 Average/Nominal Standard conversation; routine tasks; lifting a heavy object -1 to -4 Hard Running while injured; solving a moderately complex puzzle; lifting a very heavy object -5 to -9 Very Hard Performing delicate surgery in poor conditions; hacking a sophisticated system; lifting an extremely heavy object -10 Extremely Hard/Nearly Impossible Performing brain surgery in a moving vehicle; hacking a military-grade system; lifting something beyond human capability This table can also be used as a reference when determining the part of the difficulty modifier determined by the inherent complexity of the task at hand. The table below provides specific examples of common situational modifiers that can be applied based on environmental conditions, physical state, equipment, social context, and task complexity, that could be added to the difficulty modifier on top of the inherent task complexity. Multiple factors can stack, but the GM should use discretion to avoid excessive modifiers that might make tasks impossible or trivial, generally capping total situational modifiers at \u00b15 to maintain game balance. Situational Factor Modifier Description Environmental Conditions Bright sunlight/glare -1 Squinting or difficulty seeing clearly Dim light -2 Reduced visibility without night vision Complete darkness -4 No visibility without special aids Rain/sleet -1 to -2 Slippery conditions and reduced visibility Heavy rain/storm -3 Severely impaired vision and movement Extreme cold -2 Reduced dexterity and stamina Extreme heat -2 Reduced stamina and focus High winds -1 to -2 Difficulty with balance and precision Zero gravity -3 Unfamiliar movement and positioning Underwater -3 to -5 Resistance and visibility issues Physical State Fatigued/tired -2 Reduced stamina and focus Rushing/under time pressure -1 to -3 Hurrying leads to mistakes Careful/extra time taken +1 to +3 Taking time improves precision Equipment/Tools Improvised tools -2 to -4 Makes the task more difficult No tools -3 to -5 Performing task without proper equipment High-quality tools +2 to +4 Superior equipment aids performance Faulty/damaged equipment -2 to -3 Equipment hampers performance Social Context Friendly/helpful observers +1 Encouragement boosts confidence Hostile/hostile observers -1 to -2 Pressure affects performance Neutral/uninterested observers 0 No significant effect Task Complexity Distracted/divided attention -2 Multitasking reduces focus Focused/single task +1 Concentration improves performance Complex multi-step task -2 to -4 Many parts increase chance of error Familiar routine task +2 Experience makes it easier Completely new/unfamiliar -3 Lack of experience hampers performance Not every factor above needs to be applied to every check. The Game Master should instead use these examples as a guideline for adjusting difficulty based on situational factors, focusing only on the most relevant modifiers for the specific situation. 5.1.4. Momentum Additional modifiers may come from temporary conditions such as Momentum , which can provide a +1 bonus to the character's skill value for the purpose of determining the target number for any subsequent action in the same scene. Momentum is a simple resource that characters either have or don't have. When a character has Momentum , they must spend it to gain the +1 bonus within the same scene. 5.1.5. Contested Actions When two characters directly oppose each other in an action, such as in a contest of strength or a race, both characters make skill checks as the initiating character's major action for their turn. The winner is determined by comparing the degree of success each character achieves, not by comparing the numerical results of their dice rolls. The resolution follows this cascading logic: Each character independently determines their degree of success by consulting the Degrees of Success and Failure table based on their roll result and target number Compare the qualitative outcomes: Critical Success > Exceptional Success > Standard Success > Marginal Failure > Exceptional Failure > Critical Failure The character with the higher degree of success wins the opposed action If both characters achieve the same degree of success, the character with the higher skill value wins If both characters have the same skill value and achieve the same degree of success, the Game Master may call for additional rolls or determine the outcome narratively This approach ensures that characters with higher skills have a better chance of success while still allowing for dramatic upsets when a lower-skilled character achieves a better degree of success. 5.1.6. Contested Extended Actions A contested extended action represents ongoing struggles between two characters that require sustained effort to maintain, such as grappling, arm wrestling, or staring contests. These actions work differently from regular extended actions in that they involve direct opposition between two characters over multiple turns. When initiating a contested extended action, the player must specify what they want to achieve with the action. This specification determines both the skill used and the effect that occurs while the action is maintained. The specific effects are determined by the Game Master based on the declared goal and the skill used. 5.1.6.1. Initiating a Contested Extended Action Declaration A character declares they are attempting to initiate a contested extended action against a specific opponent The player specifies what they want to achieve, which determines both the skill used and the effect that occurs while the action is maintained Initial Contest The initating character makes a contested skill check against their target, as normal The skill used should be appropriate to the declared goal Resolution If the initiating character succeeds against their opponent, the contested extended action is initiated and the declared effect begins If the initiating character fails, the contested extended action does not begin 5.1.6.2. Maintaining a Contested Extended Action Once initiated, maintaining a contested extended action requires ongoing effort: On the Initiating Character's Turn: The initiating character must declare they are maintaining the contested extended action If the initiating character does not declare this, the contested extended action ends The opponent is released on their next turn and may act normally The initiating character can resume taking normal actions on their subsequent turn The initiating character may not take normal actions on the same turn as they released a contested action If the initiating character chooses to maintain the contested extended action, they must make another contested action against the same opponent as their major action On the Opponent's Turn: The opponent may take other actions during their turn if the type of contested action does not prevent them from doing so The declared effect of the contested extended action determines what actions the opponent cannot take The opponent may instead choose, as their major action for that turn, to \"enter the contest\" The opponent makes their own contested action against the initiating character of the contested extended action This contested action must use the exact same skill that the initiating character used The rules for resolving this contested action are the same as for resolving an initiator's contested action Resolving the Contested Action: If the initiating character wins, they maintain control of the contested extended action and the declared effect continues If the opponent wins, the contested extended action ends and the opponent gains Momentum as their upper hand Only the initiating character may choose to stop maintaining the contested extended action at any time The contested extended action ends immediately when the initiating character chooses to stop maintaining it The declared effect of the contested extended action only applies while the action is maintained This system represents the ongoing nature of physical struggles and mental contests that require continuous effort to maintain, while still allowing for clear resolution of who has the upper hand at any given moment. The non-consensual nature of the opponent's participation reflects that they are automatically considered to be resisting the initiating character's attempt to maintain control over them. Kaelen saw his chance. The enemy soldier was reloading, exposing his flank. Rather than shoot, Kaelen lunged, initiating a grapple. He won the initial contested roll, and the fight became a close-quarters struggle. On the enemy's turn, trapped in the grapple, he used his Major Action to \"enter the contest,\" trying to break free. He made a contested Combat (Melee) check against Kaelen and won. The GM described the sudden reversal: \"The soldier twists violently in your grip, breaking your hold! He shoves you back, seizing the initiative and gaining Momentum .\" The air in the spaceport cantina was thick with engine fumes and cheap synth-ale. Kaelen found himself in an arm-wrestling match with a hulking docker. Kaelen's Physical (Strength) is 12, while the docker's is a mighty 14. They both roll. Kaelen gets an 8, a Standard Success. The docker rolls a 13, also a Standard Success. The GM narrates the outcome: \"You both strain, muscles bulging, but with the degrees of success tied, the docker's higher skill value of 14 gives him the edge. His raw power is just too much, and he slowly forces your hand down to the table. He wins.\" 5.1.7. Group Actions When a group of characters works together on a task, the Game Master determines which character has the highest relevant skill. That character makes the primary skill check. Other characters may provide assistance, granting a +1 bonus to the primary character's roll for each assisting character, up to a maximum bonus of +3. If two or more characters have the same value in a skill relevant to the action (even if the skills themselves are not identical), and the first attempt does not go well, the group may attempt the action again in the same turn using a different character with the same value in a skill relevant to the action as the primary actor. The same bonuses for additional helpers still apply to this second attempt. This allows for a rapid second attempt by a different character, serving as an exception to the general restriction on repeating skill checks. Characters can also work independently on the same task. In this case, each character makes their own skill check. The Game Master determines how the individual results combine to affect the overall outcome. For example, a heavy blast door, dented and sparking, blocked the team's escape. Dr. Aris and two security guards put their shoulders to it. The guards both have a Physical (Strength) of 11, while Aris is a meager 8. The GM explained, \"The guard with the best footing will be the primary actor, rolling against his skill of 11. The other guard and Dr. Aris provide assistance, granting a +2 bonus. Your total target number to force this door is 13.\" 5.1.8. Extended Actions Some tasks require sustained effort over time rather than a single roll. For these extended actions, the Game Master sets a required number of turns based on the complexity and duration of the task. Characters must make skill checks on each turn until they have successfully completed the required number of turns. Extended actions can occur in two contexts: Planned Extended Actions : Tasks that are inherently complex or time-consuming, such as crafting items, conducting research, or performing complex repairs. Gritted Retries : Tasks that were previously failed with a marginal failure and are being retried with renewed determination. In this case, the action requires two turns to succeed as the character pushes themselves harder, and the player must accept a consequence (taking harm, damaging an item, or granting an enemy Momentum for their next action, of any kind) as the cost of this extra effort. The outcome of each turn's check determines the progress: Standard Success or Exceptional Success : The character completes the turn's work and counts it toward the total required turns Critical Success : The character finishes the rest of the task all in that one turn, immediately completing the entire extended action Marginal Failure : The character doesn't make progress on this turn but can continue the task on subsequent turns without penalty Exceptional Failure or Critical Failure : The character fails catastrophically and must attempt the task all over again (if the Game Master will allow a retry) This system allows for dramatic moments where a character can suddenly overcome a long task with a single amazing roll, while also providing meaningful consequences for poor performance that don't necessarily end the action immediately. The time between checks and other consequences of failures are determined by the Game Master based on the narrative circumstances. Jax's fingers flew across the holographic interface of a corporate vault's mag-lock. The GM told him this was an Extended Action requiring 3 successful turns. Turn 1: He rolled a 7 against his skill of 11\u2014a success. One down. Turn 2: He hit a snag, rolling a 13\u2014a Marginal Failure. He made no progress. Turn 3: Undeterred, he tried a new approach and rolled a 4\u2014a Critical Success! The GM grinned. \"You're struggling, but then you spot a critical flaw in their logic. With a flurry of commands, you shatter the entire security suite in seconds. The lock clicks open. The job is done.\" 5.2. Consequences The outcomes of actions in OpenAxiom are determined by the degree of success or failure. Rolling under the target number results in success, while rolling over results in failure. 5.2.1. Degrees of Success and Failure Not all successes and failures are equal. OpenAxiom distinguishes between different degrees of success and failure based on how much the roll deviates from the target number. Degree of Success/Failure Roll Result Description GM Guidance Critical Success 3 or 4 Exceptional performance that exceeds normal capabilities. Narrate as particularly impressive or fortunate outcomes. Exceptional Success 5 or more below target number Above-average performance. May provide minor additional benefits. Standard Success Equal to target or 1-4 below target Competent performance. Standard success with no additional benefits. Marginal Failure 1-4 above target number Near-success. May have some positive outcomes despite the overall failure. Exceptional Failure 5 or more above target number Particularly poor performance. May have additional negative consequences besides simple failure Critical Failure 17 or 18 Catastrophic performance. Narrate as particularly disastrous or unfortunate outcomes. 5.2.2. Probability of Degrees of Success and Failure at Different Difficulty Levels The 3d6 roll follows a bell curve distribution, with results near the middle (10-11) being most common and results at the extremes (3 and 18) being rare. The graph below shows the probability of achieving each degree of success or failure for a character with a skill of 9 at different difficulty levels: This visualization shows how the probabilities shift as the difficulty of a task changes. At easier difficulties (higher target numbers), success becomes more likely, while at harder difficulties (lower target numbers), failure becomes more likely. The graph makes it clear that characters with average skills (target 9) on medium difficulty tasks will most commonly experience either a standard success or a marginal failure. 5.2.3. Critical Success A critical success represents an exceptional performance that exceeds normal capabilities. When a character achieves a critical success, they not only accomplish their intended goal but often gain additional benefits or insights that weren't anticipated. These might include: Gaining extra information beyond what was sought Completing the task with time to spare Creating an advantageous situation for future actions Impressing observers or gaining reputation benefits Avoiding potential complications or hazards In terms of character advancement, critical successes have special significance: When a critical success occurs at a pivotal story moment, it opens the possibility for the player to spend story points to gain new positive traits through the Crucible Roll process, as detailed in the Character Advancement section on Gaining Positive Traits . This represents the character having a transformative experience that could fundamentally change who they are. Even if the critical success did not occur at a pivotal story moment, the player is granted one story point that they can bank for future use. This reward recognizes that exceptional performance, even in routine circumstances, demonstrates the character's growing capabilities and potential. Critical successes should be celebrated as significant moments in a character's development, representing times when they exceed their normal limits and potentially glimpse new possibilities for growth. 5.2.4. Exceptional Success An exceptional success indicates above-average performance that goes beyond what was expected. Characters who achieve exceptional successes: Accomplish their goals with notable skill May gain minor additional benefits Create positive ripple effects in the narrative Demonstrate expertise that might influence NPC reactions Exceptional successes represent the character operating at peak performance and can be used by the Game Master to highlight a character's expertise or specialties. In addition to these narrative benefits, exceptional successes grants characters Momentum , which provides a mechanical benefit for subsequent actions. The rules for how Momentum applies to future skill checks are detailed in the Momentum section under Actions. The logic for how it is gained is as follows: If the player didn't already have Momentum, then they gain it. If the player had Momentum for the skill check that resulted in the current exceptional success, they gain Momentum again. If the player already had Momentum, and has \"gained it again\" even without using it (which can happen if they roll an exceptional success a second time within the same scene, before they've decided what to use their existing Momentum on), it does not stack, they just keep the existing Momentum. This represents characters \"getting into the flow\" or \"getting high on success,\" encouraging players to keep the actual momentum of play going, and giving them an interesting tatical advantage to play with, as they can act in more risky ways. 5.2.5. Standard Success A standard success represents competent performance - the character achieves their intended goal without complications but also without additional benefits. This is the most common outcome for characters with average skills attempting moderate difficulty tasks. Standard successes: Achieve the intended goal directly Proceed without narrative embellishment Represent reliable, everyday competence Form the backbone of routine character activities Standard successes are important because they keep the game moving forward without bogging it down in constant exceptional outcomes. They represent the baseline of competent performance that players should expect from their characters. 5.2.6. Marginal Failure A marginal failure indicates a near-success where the character almost achieved their goal. When a character suffers a marginal failure, they have one of two choices. They can accept the failure and move on, or they can retry with grit . Retry With Grit : The character can retry the action with renewed determination, putting more effort into the attempt. This approach turns the desired action into an Extended Action that must last two turns, but it also comes with a cost. The player rolls 1d6 on the Marginal Failure Outcomes Table to determine the specific consequence that represents the toll of this extra effort. Roll 1d6 Marginal Failure Outcome 1-2 Take Harm : The character takes one level of harm on a relevant tracker, but it can't push the tracker past level 1. The physical or mental strain of pushing themselves takes its toll. 3-4 Item Damage : A relevant item (that is not a skill prerequisite) becomes damaged and temporarily unusable, but can be repaired. The intense effort damages their equipment or resources. 5-6 Enemy Momentum : An enemy gains Momentum for their next action, of any kind. The delay and initial shock of failing the action gives the enemy initiative. While the retry takes longer for the player, the increased effort of an Extended Action makes it more likely to succeed. Kaelen was halfway up a sheer, rain-slicked cliff when his handhold gave way. He rolled an 11 against his Physical (Climbing) of 10\u2014a Marginal Failure. He dangled precariously. \"I'm not giving up,\" his player said. \"I'll Retry With Grit .\" The GM nodded. \"Okay, this is now a two-turn Extended Action, but there's a cost. Roll on the Marginal Failure table.\" The player rolled a 3: Item Damage . \"As you scramble for a new hold,\" the GM narrated, \"the strap on your gear pack snags and rips. The pack, with your spare ammo, tumbles into the chasm below. It's gone. Now, make your first roll for the climb.\" 5.2.7. Exceptional Failure An exceptional failure represents particularly poor performance that goes beyond simple failure. These outcomes: Create additional negative consequences beyond simple failure May harm the character's position or resources Can damage reputation or relationships Often require additional recovery actions Exceptional failures should have meaningful consequences that affect the narrative, but shouldn't be so punishing as to derail the game. They work best when they create interesting complications rather than simple setbacks. When a character suffers an exceptional failure, the player rolls 1d6 on the Exceptional Failure Outcomes Table to determine the specific consequence: Roll 1d6 Exceptional Failure Outcome 1 Take Significant Physical Harm : The character takes one level of physical harm on a relevant tracker (can push the harm tracker up to level 2) 2 Serious Item Damage : Any item (a treasured lore item, skill prerequisite or skill check in a box) becomes damaged and temporarily unusable (but can be repaired) 3 Enemy Momentum : An enemy gains Momentum for their next action, of any kind 4 Worsening Situation : The character's action not only fails but actively makes the situation worse. The Game Master describes how the failure creates additional complications or obstacles. In addition, the character takes one level of mental harm on a relevant tracker (can push the harm tracker up to level 2) 5 Resource Drain : A valuable resource is expended or lost. This could be ammunition, power cells, medical supplies, or other relevant consumables. If the character has no applicable resources, they instead suffer a level of mental harm as they realize their unpreparedness 6 Reputation Damage : The character's failure is witnessed or becomes known to others, damaging their reputation or relationships. This is particularly relevant for social interactions but can apply to any situation where others might observe the failure. The character suffers a -1 penalty to all Social skill checks for the remainder of the scene Dr. Aris stood before the Hyperion corporate board, his voice pleading for funding. His Social (Diplomacy) was 12, but he rolled a 17\u2014an Exceptional Failure. \"This is bad,\" the GM said. \"Roll on the Exceptional Failure table.\" The result was a 6: Reputation Damage . \"Your plea comes across as desperate and unhinged,\" the GM explained. \"They not only reject your proposal, but your reputation with Hyperion Corporation drops by 1. For the rest of this meeting, they view you with disdain, giving you a -1 penalty to all Social checks.\" 5.2.8. Critical Failure A critical failure indicates catastrophic performance that can have severe narrative consequences. These might include: Creating dangerous situations for the character or allies Attracting unwanted attention from enemies Damaging equipment or resources Causing significant setbacks to plans In addition to these narrative consequences, critical failures have specific mechanical effects. When a character suffers a critical failure, they move up one level on a harm tracker related to the skill that was being used when the skill check failed, as detailed in the Character Status Effects section . If multiple harm trackers could apply, the Game Master should choose the one with the current lowest level, following the Least Harmed Principle . This represents the character compensating for their wounds by leaning more heavily on their other capabilities. A critical failure can only push any harm tracker up to level 2 (Impaired). Beyond that point, there may be narrative consequences to a critical failure, but no additional mechanical effects. This limitation prevents critical failures from being overly punitive while still providing meaningful consequences for catastrophic performance. Information about Harm Tracker Levels and Penalties can be found in the Character Mechanics section. Critical failures are dramatic moments that can shift the direction of a scene or even an entire campaign. They should be used sparingly and with consideration for their impact on the overall narrative.","title":"Logic of Action"},{"location":"logic_of_action.html#5-logic-of-action","text":"This section describes the decision resolution mechanism for actions in OpenAxiom.

The player rolls 3d6 and sums the results. If the total is less than or equal to the target number, the action succeeds. If the total is greater than the target number, the action fails. The target number is almost always determined by the character's relevant skill values, modified by the difficulty of the check. This is the inverse of a game system like D&D, where the target number is fixed, and then the roll is modified by your skill level. This simple mechanic underlies all character actions in the game. The target number is determined by the character's relevant skill value, modified by applicable traits and situational factors as determined by the Game Master. Characters may also receive temporary modifiers from systems like Momentum , which can provide a +1 bonus to the character's skill value for the purpose of determining the target number for any action in the same scene.","title":"5.1.

Trait modifiers : Any modifiers applied by the player's traits to the skill value. Adding these forms the effective skill value .

That character makes the primary skill check. Other characters may provide assistance, granting a +1 bonus to the primary character's roll for each assisting character, up to a maximum bonus of +3. If two or more characters have the same value in a skill relevant to the action (even if the skills themselves are not identical), and the first attempt does not go well, the group may attempt the action again in the same turn using a different character with the same value in a skill relevant to the action as the primary actor. The same bonuses for additional helpers still apply to this second attempt. This allows for a rapid second attempt by a different character, serving as an exception to the general restriction on repeating skill checks. Characters can also work independently on the same task. In this case, each character makes their own skill check. The Game Master determines how the individual results combine to affect the overall outcome. For example, a heavy blast door, dented and sparking, blocked the team's escape. Dr. Aris and two security guards put their shoulders to it. The guards both have a Physical (Strength) of 11, while Aris is a meager 8. The GM explained, \"The guard with the best footing will be the primary actor, rolling against his skill of 11.

Group Actions"},{"location":"logic_of_action.html#518-extended-actions","text":"Some tasks require sustained effort over time rather than a single roll. For these extended actions, the Game Master sets a required number of turns based on the complexity and duration of the task. Characters must make skill checks on each turn until they have successfully completed the required number of turns. Extended actions can occur in two contexts: Planned Extended Actions : Tasks that are inherently complex or time-consuming, such as crafting items, conducting research, or performing complex repairs. Gritted Retries : Tasks that were previously failed with a marginal failure and are being retried with renewed determination. In this case, the action requires two turns to succeed as the character pushes themselves harder, and the player must accept a consequence (taking harm, damaging an item, or granting an enemy Momentum for their next action, of any kind) as the cost of this extra effort. The outcome of each turn's check determines the progress: Standard Success or Exceptional Success : The character completes the turn's work and counts it toward the total required turns Critical Success : The character finishes the rest of the task all in that one turn, immediately completing the entire extended action Marginal Failure : The character doesn't make progress on this turn but can continue the task on subsequent turns without penalty Exceptional Failure or Critical Failure : The character fails catastrophically and must attempt the task all over again (if the Game Master will allow a retry) This system allows for dramatic moments where a character can suddenly overcome a long task with a single amazing roll, while also providing meaningful consequences for poor performance that don't necessarily end the action immediately. The time between checks and other consequences of failures are determined by the Game Master based on the narrative circumstances. Jax's fingers flew across the holographic interface of a corporate vault's mag-lock. The GM told him this was an Extended Action requiring 3 successful turns.

This represents the character having a transformative experience that could fundamentally change who they are. Even if the critical success did not occur at a pivotal story moment, the player is granted one story point that they can bank for future use. This reward recognizes that exceptional performance, even in routine circumstances, demonstrates the character's growing capabilities and potential.

In addition to these narrative benefits, exceptional successes grants characters Momentum , which provides a mechanical benefit for subsequent actions. The rules for how Momentum applies to future skill checks are detailed in the Momentum section under Actions. The logic for how it is gained is as follows: If the player didn't already have Momentum, then they gain it. If the player had Momentum for the skill check that resulted in the current exceptional success, they gain Momentum again. If the player already had Momentum, and has \"gained it again\" even without using it (which can happen if they roll an exceptional success a second time within the same scene, before they've decided what to use their existing Momentum on), it does not stack, they just keep the existing Momentum.

When a character suffers a marginal failure, they have one of two choices. They can accept the failure and move on, or they can retry with grit . Retry With Grit : The character can retry the action with renewed determination, putting more effort into the attempt. This approach turns the desired action into an Extended Action that must last two turns, but it also comes with a cost. The player rolls 1d6 on the Marginal Failure Outcomes Table to determine the specific consequence that represents the toll of this extra effort. Roll 1d6 Marginal Failure Outcome 1-2 Take Harm : The character takes one level of harm on a relevant tracker, but it can't push the tracker past level 1. The physical or mental strain of pushing themselves takes its toll. 3-4 Item Damage : A relevant item (that is not a skill prerequisite) becomes damaged and temporarily unusable, but can be repaired. The intense effort damages their equipment or resources. 5-6 Enemy Momentum : An enemy gains Momentum for their next action, of any kind. The delay and initial shock of failing the action gives the enemy initiative. While the retry takes longer for the player, the increased effort of an Extended Action makes it more likely to succeed.

Social Relations OpenAxiom recognizes that social interactions and factional relations are often just as crucial to roleplaying narratives as combat. Thus, it tries to provide a structured system for tracking how characters relate to each other and to various factions for tables that want serious mechanical consequences and tactical choice and resource management for their social interactions as much as their violent ones. Like the combat rules, this system is completely optional : the core logic of action rules should be more than enough to resolve social actions and consequences for tables that don't desire extra depth. 8.1. Faction Identification Factions provide context for social interactions by helping to determine how different characters might react to each other. For example, a character from a military faction might have automatic tensions with someone from a rebel faction, while two characters from the same guild might have an easier time building rapport. Characters in OpenAxiom belong to one faction each, which represents their primary affiliation, organization, culture, or other group with shared interests. Every character, whether player character, NPC, or enemy, is associated with such a faction. This could be as broad as a nation or as specific as a secret society. Player characters establish their primary faction during character creation. See the Character Creation chapter for details on how to select an appropriate faction for your character and the initial reputation that comes with it. 8.2. Reputation With Factions A character's reputation with a faction represents how a specific character is viewed by members of that faction. This system allows for complex social dynamics where individual actions can affect how others perceive you, regardless of your own faction affiliation. 8.2.1. Reputation Tracking Each character maintains a reputation score from -5 to 5 with every faction they've encountered. This is tracked on the character sheet as follows: When first meeting a character from a new faction, a new reputation line is created, with a default value determined by the rules in the Default Reputation section. Reputation ranges from -5 (completely despised) to 5 (universally admired), with 0 representing a neutral standing Reputation is tracked separately for each faction encountered, meaning a character could be highly respected by one faction (score of 3-5) and poorly regarded by another (score of -5 to -3). 8.2.2. Default Reputation: Faction Relationships Factions have relationships with each other that exist independently of individual characters. These relationships provide a baseline for how members of different factions interact by defining a character's default starting reputation. There are three basic relationship states between factions: Friendly : Factions that generally get along, cooperate, or share common goals Neutral : Factions that have no particular feelings toward each other Hostile : Factions that are actively opposed to each other These relationships are established by the Game Master as part of the campaign's world-building and can shift over time based on events in the game. When player characters encounter a new faction for the first time, their initial reputation with that faction is determined by the relationship between that faction and any factions the character has already encountered. This is determined by the following rules, in descending order of precedence: Friendly Relationship : If the new faction is friendly to any faction the character has a reputation with already, the character starts with a reputation score the same as the lowest reputation score they have with a faction that the new one is friendly to. For example, say your character has a +4 reputation with the Empire and a -2 reputation with the Smugglers' Guild. You encounter the Trade Federation, which is Friendly to both the Empire and the Guild. Because the rule uses your lowest reputation among friendly factions, your starting reputation with the Trade Federation is -2. Hostile Relationship : If the new faction is hostile to any faction the character has a reputation with already, the character starts with a reputation score of 0 minus the highest reputation score they have with a faction that the new one is hostile to (in other words, the negative version of that reputation score). For example, if you meet the Rebel faction, and you have a reputation of 4 with the Empire, and a reputation of -2 with the Trade Federation, then your reputation with the Rebels will be -4, since your highest reputation with a faction hostile to the Rebels is 4, not -2, and 0 - 4 is -4. Neutral Relationship : If the new faction is neutral toward every faction the character has already built a reputation with, the character starts with the default reputation score of 0. The Game Master should determine the relationships between factions during campaign preparation and note them for reference during play. Jax, with his +4 Street Runner reputation, met with a representative of the Dockworkers' Union for the first time. The GM had established that the Union was Friendly to the Runners. The GM explained, \"The Union foreman sizes you up. He's heard good things about the Runners and knows you're one of them. Following the rule for friendly factions, your starting reputation with the Dockworkers' Union is the same as your reputation with the Street Runners. You start at +4.\" 8.2.3. Changing Reputation Reputation with a faction can change whenever a character interacts with members of that faction through social skill checks (usually Social or Social (\u2026) ): Degree of Success on Social Skill Check Reputation Change With Faction Critical Success +3 (capped at 5) Exceptional Success +1 Standard Success No change Marginal Failure No change Exceptional Failure -1 Critical Failure -3 (minimum of -5) These changes only apply when the social interaction is with a member of the faction whose reputation is being affected. For example, impressing a military officer would improve your reputation with the military faction, but not with a merchant guild. The Game Master determines when a social interaction is significant enough to affect reputation. Minor interactions like asking for directions typically don't affect reputation, while major negotiations, public speeches, or acts of heroism/villainy would. 8.2.4. Reputation Effects A character's reputation with a faction affects social interactions with members of that faction: Reputation Range Modifier High Reputation (3-5) +1 bonus to social skill checks Neutral Reputation (-2 to 2) No modifier Poor Reputation (-5 to -3) -1 penalty to social skill checks These modifiers are applied to the target number when making social skill checks against members of that faction. 8.2.5. Spending Reputation for Advantage Characters can treat their reputation with various factions as social capital, spending it to gain advantages in critical moments. When a character spends reputation, they reduce their reputation score with that faction by a certain amount to gain a benefit. Spending reputation in this way represents the character calling in favors, using their status, or leveraging their influence to achieve specific goals. Characters can spend reputation in one of three ways: Additional Bonus on Faction-Related Skill Checks : Spend 1 point of reputation with a faction to add an additional +1 bonus to any Social skill check with that faction. This bonus stacks with the existing reputation modifier. Reroll a Critical Failure : Spend 1 reputation point with a faction to reroll any critical failure made in a Social skill check with that faction. The character must accept the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. Vouch for a Friend : Spend 1 reputation point with a faction to vouch for a friend's character with that faction. This temporarily grants the friend the character's (pre-spend) reputation score with that faction for the course of one scene, if it is higher than the friend's own. The friend's reputation with the faction returns to its normal value at the end of the scene. After spending reputation, the character's reputation score with that faction is reduced by the amount spent. Jax needed the Union foreman to \"lose\" a valuable shipping container, a very risky ask. His reputation with the Union stood at a solid +4. To improve his odds, Jax's player said, \"This is a crucial roll. I'm going to spend 1 point of my reputation to call in a favor.\" The GM updated the character sheet. \"Okay, your reputation with the Union is now +3. For this one check, you'll get a +1 bonus for your high reputation, plus an additional +1 for spending the point. You get a total of +2 to your social check.\" 8.2.6. Reputation Actions Players can take specific actions that directly affect their reputation with factions. The reputation changes from these actions are in addition to any changes from social skill checks during interactions with faction members. Each type of action has a specific reputation bonus or penalty: Action Reputation Change Description Betrayal -3 Characters who betray a faction's trust suffer a significant reputation penalty. Betrayal includes actions like revealing faction secrets, sabotaging faction operations, or directly working against the faction's interests. Salvation +3 Characters who save a faction or its members from significant harm gain a substantial reputation bonus. Salvation includes actions like rescuing faction leaders, defending faction territory from attackers, or preventing disasters that would harm the faction. Missions/Quests +2 Characters who complete missions or quests for a faction gain a reputation bonus. These are tasks performed for the faction without direct payment, showing dedication to the faction's goals. Jobs +1 Characters who complete paid jobs for a faction gain a smaller reputation bonus. While jobs show the character is trustworthy and competent, they are primarily business transactions rather than acts of dedication. Failing Missions/Quests -2 Characters who fail to complete missions or quests for a faction suffer a reputation penalty. This reflects the faction's disappointment in the character's inability to fulfill their commitments. Failing Jobs -1 Characters who fail to complete paid jobs for a faction suffer a reputation penalty. While less severe than failing an unpaid mission, failing a job still damages trust. Ignoring or Going Back on Jobs -2 Characters who ignore or go back on agreed-upon jobs without completing them suffer a reputation penalty. This is as severe as failing a mission because it shows the character cannot be trusted to honor their agreements. 8.3. Using Social Relations in Play The social relations system is designed to add depth to roleplaying encounters without slowing down gameplay. Here's how to incorporate it into your game: 8.3.1. Tracking First Encounters When player characters meet NPCs or enemies from factions they haven't encountered before, the Game Master should note this and create a new reputation entry starting at 0. This can be done quickly during play and doesn't need to interrupt the flow of the game. 8.3.2. Social Skill Checks When a player attempts a social skill check against an NPC, the Game Master should consider whether the interaction is significant enough to affect reputation. As a general rule: Routine interactions (asking for directions, ordering food) don't affect reputation Extended interactions (negotiations, lengthy conversations) might affect reputation Pivotal interactions (alliance negotiations, public speeches, acts of heroism or villainy) always affect reputation After resolving a social skill check that affects reputation, the Game Master should adjust the appropriate reputation score and note any mechanical effects for future interactions. 8.4. Social Combat Characters can engage in social combat, attempting to damage another character's reputation with a specific faction through slander, propaganda, or other means of social manipulation. This represents the cut and thrust of social maneuvering where characters try to undermine each other's standing in a community. Social combat is a simple gloss on the Contested Action rules found in the Action chapter , following the following steps: Initiation : Any character can initiate social combat against another character they know has a reputation with a faction. The initiating character must declare the target character, and the reputation with which faction they are targeting. The target character must already have an established reputation with that faction. Resolution : Social combat is resolved as a Contested Action between the initiating character and the target character. Each participant uses any relevant social skill (such as Social (Diplomacy) , Social (Deception) , or Social (Performance) ). The modifier for each participant's skill check is determined by their own reputation with the faction being targeted. If the initiating character lacks a reputation with the targeted faction, they use the default score of 0 for their check. Outcomes : If the initiating character fails the contested action, they lose one point of reputation with the targeted faction as their attempts to slander another are seen as desperate or unseemly. If the initiating character succeeds, the target character loses one point of reputation with the targeted faction as their standing has been successfully undermined. Jax's rival, Silk, decided to undermine his standing with the Dockworkers' Union. She initiated social combat, starting a whisper campaign. This resolved as a Contested Action. Silk used her Social (Deception) of 12, while Jax defended with his Social (Diplomacy) of 10. His +3 reputation with the Union gave him a +1 bonus, for a target of 11. Silk rolled an 8 (Standard Success), while Jax rolled a 12 (Marginal Failure). The GM delivered the outcome: \"Silk, your rumors are subtle but effective. Jax, you fail to counter them. Your reputation with the Dockworkers' Union drops by one point, from +3 to +2.\"","title":"Social Relations"},{"location":"social_relations.html#8-social-relations","text":"OpenAxiom recognizes that social interactions and factional relations are often just as crucial to roleplaying narratives as combat.

The character must accept the result of the second roll, even if it is worse. Vouch for a Friend : Spend 1 reputation point with a faction to vouch for a friend's character with that faction. This temporarily grants the friend the character's (pre-spend) reputation score with that faction for the course of one scene, if it is higher than the friend's own. The friend's reputation with the faction returns to its normal value at the end of the scene. After spending reputation, the character's reputation score with that faction is reduced by the amount spent. Jax needed the Union foreman to \"lose\" a valuable shipping container, a very risky ask. His reputation with the Union stood at a solid +4. To improve his odds, Jax's player said, \"This is a crucial roll. I'm going to spend 1 point of my reputation to call in a favor.\" The GM updated the character sheet. \"Okay, your reputation with the Union is now +3. For this one check, you'll get a +1 bonus for your high reputation, plus an additional +1 for spending the point. You get a total of +2 to your social check.\"","title":"8.2.5. Spending Reputation for Advantage"},{"location":"social_relations.html#826-reputation-actions","text":"Players can take specific actions that directly affect their reputation with factions. The reputation changes from these actions are in addition to any changes from social skill checks during interactions with faction members. Each type of action has a specific reputation bonus or penalty: Action Reputation Change Description Betrayal -3 Characters who betray a faction's trust suffer a significant reputation penalty. Betrayal includes actions like revealing faction secrets, sabotaging faction operations, or directly working against the faction's interests. Salvation +3 Characters who save a faction or its members from significant harm gain a substantial reputation bonus. Salvation includes actions like rescuing faction leaders, defending faction territory from attackers, or preventing disasters that would harm the faction. Missions/Quests +2 Characters who complete missions or quests for a faction gain a reputation bonus. These are tasks performed for the faction without direct payment, showing dedication to the faction's goals. Jobs +1 Characters who complete paid jobs for a faction gain a smaller reputation bonus. While jobs show the character is trustworthy and competent, they are primarily business transactions rather than acts of dedication. Failing Missions/Quests -2 Characters who fail to complete missions or quests for a faction suffer a reputation penalty. This reflects the faction's disappointment in the character's inability to fulfill their commitments. Failing Jobs -1 Characters who fail to complete paid jobs for a faction suffer a reputation penalty. While less severe than failing an unpaid mission, failing a job still damages trust. Ignoring or Going Back on Jobs -2 Characters who ignore or go back on agreed-upon jobs without completing them suffer a reputation penalty. This is as severe as failing a mission because it shows the character cannot be trusted to honor their agreements.","title":"8.2.6.

As a general rule: Routine interactions (asking for directions, ordering food) don't affect reputation Extended interactions (negotiations, lengthy conversations) might affect reputation Pivotal interactions (alliance negotiations, public speeches, acts of heroism or villainy) always affect reputation After resolving a social skill check that affects reputation, the Game Master should adjust the appropriate reputation score and note any mechanical effects for future interactions.","title":"8.3.2. Social Skill Checks"},{"location":"social_relations.html#84-social-combat","text":"Characters can engage in social combat, attempting to damage another character's reputation with a specific faction through slander, propaganda, or other means of social manipulation. This represents the cut and thrust of social maneuvering where characters try to undermine each other's standing in a community. Social combat is a simple gloss on the Contested Action rules found in the Action chapter , following the following steps: Initiation : Any character can initiate social combat against another character they know has a reputation with a faction. The initiating character must declare the target character, and the reputation with which faction they are targeting. The target character must already have an established reputation with that faction. Resolution : Social combat is resolved as a Contested Action between the initiating character and the target character. Each participant uses any relevant social skill (such as Social (Diplomacy) , Social (Deception) , or Social (Performance) ). The modifier for each participant's skill check is determined by their own reputation with the faction being targeted. If the initiating character lacks a reputation with the targeted faction, they use the default score of 0 for their check. Outcomes : If the initiating character fails the contested action, they lose one point of reputation with the targeted faction as their attempts to slander another are seen as desperate or unseemly. If the initiating character succeeds, the target character loses one point of reputation with the targeted faction as their standing has been successfully undermined. Jax's rival, Silk, decided to undermine his standing with the Dockworkers' Union. She initiated social combat, starting a whisper campaign. This resolved as a Contested Action. Silk used her Social (Deception) of 12, while Jax defended with his Social (Diplomacy) of 10. His +3 reputation with the Union gave him a +1 bonus, for a target of 11. Silk rolled an 8 (Standard Success), while Jax rolled a 12 (Marginal Failure). The GM delivered the outcome: \"Silk, your rumors are subtle but effective. Jax, you fail to counter them. Your reputation with the Dockworkers' Union drops by one point, from +3 to +2.\"","title":"8.4. Social Combat"},{"location":"packs/general.html","text":"1.
