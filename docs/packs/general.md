| Flashbacks | Special, Situational | Mental (Willpower) | -3 | A specific trigger (e.g., a loud noise, the smell of smoke) causes you to have traumatic flashbacks.

| Hunted | Special | N/A | Player-chosen (-1 to -5) | You are actively pursued by a powerful faction or individual from your past. The GM can use this to introduce complications, enemies, and plot hooks at any time. The more points gained, the more powerful the hunter. |
