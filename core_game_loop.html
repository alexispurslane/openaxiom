                <h1 id="4-core-game-loop">4. Core Game Loop</h1>
<p>OpenAxiom uses two distinct types of game time to create a dynamic and flexible gameplay experience: tactical time and scene time. These different pacing mechanisms allow the game to shift between intense, structured sequences and free-flowing narrative moments as needed.</p>
<p>The transition between tactical and scene time is a binary decision made by the Game Master based on the needs of the narrative and the intensity of the situation.</p>
<h2 id="41-units-of-time">4.1. Units of Time</h2>
<p>There are five main units of time in OpenAxiom. Here they are, in order of granularity:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Turn</strong>: a unit of time comprising a participant spending their action points on various actions before other participants get to act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Round</strong>: a unit of time comprising one iteration through each player (and NPC and enemy) getting their turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scene</strong>: a continuous period of gameplay that uses a single type of time. A new scene begins whenever the Game Master switches between tactical time and scene time. For example, an entire combat encounter run using tactical time is one scene. The period of free-flowing roleplaying that happens in scene time right after that combat is another scene.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session</strong>: a session of play for the day/week/month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Campaign</strong>: a full narrative with a beginning, middle, and end, composed of sessions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="42-tactical-time">4.2. Tactical Time</h2>
<p>Tactical time is used during combat encounters, chases, or any situation where precise timing and turn order are important. During tactical time, all participants (players, NPCs, and enemies) take turns in a specific order determined by initiative rolls.</p>
<h3 id="421-initiative">4.2.1. Initiative</h3>
<p>At the start of tactical time, all participants roll 3d6. Turns are taken in order from lowest to highest roll. In the case of ties, participants with the same roll go in clockwise order from the Game Master.</p>
<p>Each full cycle through all participants constitutes one round of tactical time. Participants retain their initiative order throughout the encounter unless specific game effects modify it.</p>
<h3 id="422-action-points">4.2.2. Action Points</h3>
<p>In tactical time, each participant has a pool of action points (AP) they can spend on various actions during their turn. Characters start each turn with action points equal to their best Physical skill related to dexterity or speed (default value of 9). As characters improve their skills through story point expenditure, their action point pool increases accordingly, allowing for more tactical options during combat.</p>
<p>Participants can spend their action points on any combination of actions that they can afford. Actions have varying costs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor Actions</strong> (3 AP)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Moving up to their normal movement speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Speaking a few words or short phrases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interacting with a mundane object (opening a door, picking up an item)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Taking cover or changing position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dropping an item or drawing a readily accessible item</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Major Actions</strong> (6 AP base cost)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Attacking an opponent with a weapon (base cost 6 AP + variable cost based on weapon skill requirements)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a skill that requires a check</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Activating a special ability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casting a spell or using advanced technology</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performing a complex task</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Participants can spend any or all of their action points during their turn. Unused Action Points are typically lost at the end of your turn. However, you may declare at the start of your turn that you are reserving a specific number of AP for a Trigger. This reserved AP is not lost at the end of your turn but is instead lost <em>before your next turn</em> (so after an entire round has passed) if the Trigger is not activated before then.</p>
<p>For example, a character with 9 action points could:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take one major action (6 AP) and one minor action (3 AP) for a total of 9 AP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take three minor actions (3 AP each) for a total of 9 AP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take one major action (6 AP) and have 3 AP remaining that would be lost</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Players who wish to set triggers (see Triggers section) must deliberately take fewer actions during their turn to maintain a reserve of unused AP that can be used for triggered actions.</p>
<h3 id="423-triggers">4.2.3. Triggers</h3>
<p>Players can specify triggers for their actions. A trigger is an if-else condition where if the condition is met, the player's character takes an action before anyone else can act.</p>
<p>The "if" part of a trigger condition must be a specific skill check, attack, movement, or posture change by another participant. This ensures triggers are tied to concrete, observable game mechanics rather than subjective interpretations.</p>
<p>Valid trigger conditions include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When a specific enemy makes a particular skill check (e.g., "If the guard makes a Perception (Visual) check")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a specific enemy makes an attack (e.g., "If the orc attacks me")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a specific enemy moves (e.g., "If the thief moves within 5 meters of the chest")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a specific enemy changes posture (e.g., "If the knight stands up from prone")</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When setting a trigger, players must reserve a pool of unused action points (AP) from their previous turn. This reserved pool is used to execute the triggered action when the trigger condition is met. Players must deliberately take fewer actions during their turn to maintain this reserve, effectively "banking" AP for potential triggers.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Trigger mechanics:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Players must declare triggers and the AP pool reserved for them at the start of their turn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reserved AP pool must be sufficient to cover the cost of the triggered action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a trigger activates but there aren't enough reserved AP to cover its cost, the trigger fails</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reserved AP that isn't used by triggered actions is lost at the end of the round</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players can adjust their reserved AP pools and triggers at the start of each turn</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>When multiple trigger actions are activated simultaneously:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They resolve in the order they were specified to the Game Master</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each triggered action consumes the appropriate action points from the character's reserved pool</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="43-scene-time">4.3. Scene Time</h2>
<p>Scene time is used for exploration, roleplaying, investigation, and other non-combat situations. During scene time, gameplay is completely free-flowing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Players act when they want to act</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no turn order or initiative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players can take as many actions as appropriate to the narrative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Game Master manages the flow of events and time naturally</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Scene time is ideal for conversations, exploration, research, and other activities where the structured pace of tactical time would be unnecessarily restrictive.</p>
<h2 id="44-rests">4.4. Rests</h2>
<p>Rests represent periods when characters take time to recover from exertion, heal injuries, and restore their mental and physical well-being. The Game Master decides when rests occur based on the narrative flow and the characters' needs.</p>
<p>Rests can only happen during scene time. This means that characters cannot rest during active combat encounters or other situations requiring tactical time. The Game Master may call for a rest when:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Characters have had a particularly challenging encounter or series of encounters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The narrative naturally provides a safe space for recovery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characters express a need to recuperate from injuries or exhaustion</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A significant amount of time has passed in the game world</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>During a rest, characters may recover from harm through natural recovery methods. A character can reduce one harm tracker by one level whenever they get adequate long rest and recuperation, allowing their body, mind, or social standing to heal naturally.</p>
<p>The Game Master determines the specific benefits of a rest based on its duration and conditions. A brief respite might provide minor benefits, while an extended period of rest in comfortable conditions could provide more substantial recovery.</p>
